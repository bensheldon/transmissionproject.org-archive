                    <p>The first half of Ethan&#8217;s term was spent generating community interest in learning technology and helping community members develop the confidence to learn more.  The second half of the term was focused on expanding that interest to self-study and home use, and to continue the access to learning.  During the course of the year, over 130 users were involved in introductory computer classes, logging roughly 1400 user hours.  Among other things, these classes built community capacity, a cadre of volunteers, and led Big Bend Community College (BBCC) to develop partnerships and open new computer labs in Mattawa and Royal&nbsp;City.</p>
<p>Ethan visited a CTC nearby in Kennewick that worked on getting refurbished computers into the homes.  They taught him that labs were not enough to get sufficient technology access to our students on a more consistent basis and that real progress for most students was dependent on there being computers in the home.  The RECA Foundation in Kennewick became our resource for refurbished computers.  Ethan was able to get computers into many of the students’ homes in Royal City and Mattawa.  The computers are geared more towards families and give kids a basis for learning.  They have security in place to prevent major problems from occurring to the operating system.  The major drawback with these computers is that they do not allow changes to the system and are not configured for use of the Internet.  However, as a beginning computer for families, they are perfect because they aren’t susceptible to viruses; as students become more comfortable with the computers, they can later invest in one that is Internet-ready. In the meantime, Internet access and ESL software remains available in the community&nbsp;labs.</p>

                    <p>Ethan helped bring much needed training to four very small rural communities in Central Washington. Bi-lingual computer training was made available to hundreds of predominantly monolingual Spanish-speaking Hispanic agricultural workers and their families. Students were able to take advantage of their abilities to learn the technology quickly, accessing information as well as learning ESL and other skills. Young and old were able to learn together and the volunteer base grew. As more and more young students begin coming in, we are able to take advantage of their abilities to learn the technology quickly.  We allowed them to teach each other as they naturally seemed to do. The labs in Mattawa and Royal City developed a sense of community, as people of all ages worked simultaneously and without fear in asking for help from one&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>The development of skills and confidence that was nurtured in the community labs led to more individual commitment to purchase computers for home use. As a result, these communities not only have new community labs, but a group of adults and children who are able to continue to deepen their knowledge and use of computers at&nbsp;home.</p>

                    <p>MAFEI’s OTX-West project is a large-scale computer reuse program, dedicated to providing computer technology access, technical support and volunteer opportunities for Oakland families. Ian Bauer has been working closely with MAFEI/OTX-West staff to meet and exceed workplan objectives as outlined&nbsp;below: </p>
<p>Provide a quality learning experience for both youth and adult volunteers (technical and non-technical) through service learning opportunities at&nbsp;OTX-West.</p>
<p>Provide a relevant, hands-on work experience for&nbsp;youth.</p>
<p>Develop Organization&nbsp;Website</p>

                    <p>Volunteer&nbsp;Training</p>
<p>Ian Bauer worked with staff and the project consultant funded by CTCNET/ATA to assess the current capacity and need for volunteers.  Ian assisted in the development of the volunteer training manual; streamlining the process for coordinating assignments for weekly “Volunteer Days” and “Distribution&nbsp;Days.”</p>
<p>As MAFEI successfully completed the training manual within the projected three-month time period, Ian coordinated the weekly management of both student and adult volunteers who had received computers from OTX-West. To date, approximately 500 student and adults have volunteered at OTX-West including IT students from local vocational programs, high school and middle school students with varying interests in computer&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Ian coordinated interns’ weekly tasks—preparing computer labs for trainings, assembling training materials, staffing distribution days.  Ian is currently developing a training model whereby interns will be able to successfully conduct computer training courses, having become proficient in basic computer software applications and increased their knowledge of computer equipment and basic hardware&nbsp;operations.</p>
<p>Website&nbsp;Development</p>
<p>MAFEI significantly benefited from Ian’s expertise and interest in website design.  Ian increased his responsibilities in this area by successfully upgrading the organization’s website(s) <a href="http://www.mafei.org" title="www.mafei.org">www.mafei.org</a> and <a href="http://www.otxwest.org" title="www.otxwest.org">www.otxwest.org</a>,&nbsp;including:</p>
<p>• Reformatting website graphics,<br />
• Updating and adding to website text for OTX-West offerings, including technical support information and computer class training on-line registration<br />
• Creating links<br />
• Providing easier navigation of&nbsp;website</p>
<p>Learning Without Boundaries Literacy&nbsp;Initiative</p>
<p>Ian contributed significantly to the development of this project.  His role was central and continues to be a vital part of the continuance of this model.  A portion of his responsibilities&nbsp;included:</p>
<p>• Researching software writing&nbsp;programs;</p>
<p>• Conducting assessments and creating computer labs in the classroom of 3rd grade teachers participating in this&nbsp;project.  </p>
<p>• Developing a training manual for parents and students, integrating key components of the writing software program and Internet research.  Students learned how to research topics, find the definition of words and phrases and successfully complete a creative writing assignment (training guide&nbsp;available).</p>
<p>• Conducting computer training classes for third grade students and their&nbsp;families.</p>

                    <p>Among Ian’s talents and strengths are his ability to quickly identify and resolve problems.  As much of this project requires work in diverse communities with limited experience with computer technology,  Ian exhibited tremendous patience and support for these families.  MAFEI equally appreciated his ability to remain flexible in a changing work environment and meet each task with a great enthusiasm and a keen sense of humor.   He was certainly a welcomed addition to our staff.<br />

                    <p>Volunteer&nbsp;Recruitment</p>
<p>Direct Service to PACER&nbsp;Center</p>
<p>A special request came from the PACER center, the Parent Center that works with families of children and young adults from birth to age 22 with a full range of disabilities: physical, mental, learning, emotional, and attention deficit disorders. Carley was asked to provide ten hours, one-to-one support to David, an adult participant of the Pacer Center. Due to the nature of the request and David&#8217;s availability, Carley couldn’t link him with a volunteer, so she provided the service herself. Carley assessed David’s computer skills to develop a curriculum that would help him to obtain the basic knowledge he needed to obtain&nbsp;employment.</p>
<p>Accelerated Reader&nbsp;Software</p>
<p>Late 2003, Pillsbury United Communities acquired Accelerated Reader software to help students increase their reading skills. About 95% of the youths that attend Pillsbury Center programs have been assessed with reading skills below their academic grade. In most cases students are two grades&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>Waite House English as Second Language&nbsp;Classes</p>
<p>Our English teacher, John, got the support of Carley to develop an English/ Computer curriculum for our ESL learners.  From January of 2004 year up to now, about 45 students have attended our computer classes. Several have developed computer&nbsp;skills</p>

                    <p>Summary of&nbsp;Accomplishments</p>
<p>•	Seven Pillsbury United Communities Technology Centers have improved their infrastructure. Staff was trained to administer their technology Center<br />
•	Created a “help” manual for each center including a Universal set of computer lab rules<br />
•	Met with Technology Center administrators of each center, to assess individual needs and provide assistance when ever possible.<br />
•	Four volunteers have been recruited for Waite House<br />
•	Upcoming Web site design class for Pillsbury United Communities Technology Center administrators, so they can teach community members at their particular location. This class will be taught by corporate volunteers.<br />
•	Assisted in the creation of an additional lab, or “Business Center” for community members<br />
•	Created promotional materials.<br />
•	Attended UNCA conference, attended workshop on how to recruit volunteers from Volunteer Resource Center and will attend “Minnesota Trainers or Trainers on Adult Learning” seminar in&nbsp;April. </p>
<p>Volunteer&nbsp;Recruitment</p>
<p>Several community members were exposed to computers for the first time during our “open Business Center hours” on Wednesday from 11:00- 1:00 pm. Volunteer staff assisted those community members in discovering the world of technology and the advantages of becoming computer literate. About 80% of these new computer users were recruited from Waite House Community café.  This Waite House service provides hot meal to low income, working families, and homeless&nbsp;people. </p>
<p>A similar strategy was implemented in the afternoons when people waited to be served by our food shelf staff. Every afternoon from 2:00-5:00 pm at least 20-25 people line up to be served. Carley met with interns from Hamline University to identify potential volunteers who could staff the Business Center during those hours. A Hamline student that wanted to improve her Spanish skills became interested in staffing the business center. She volunteered two hours every Monday from 3:00- 5:00 for ten weeks.  Several seniors were provided service during those hours; their most frequent questions were about how to look for services in the&nbsp;Internet.</p>
<p>Direct&nbsp;Service</p>
<p>Carley and David met once a week, two hours for five weeks. David learned to navigate the Internet to do job search. He also signed up with an e-mail provider. He developed basic skills on the use of Microsoft Word. David also developed a resume and cover&nbsp;letter.</p>
<p>Accelerated Reader&nbsp;Software</p>
<p>Carley helped to teach youth workers the use of this software. According to our last quarter report, for September 30th, 2004, two hundred twenty youth are enrolled into the Accelerated Reader program and about 80% of them have advanced one or more reading levels. Waite House alone reports 55 youth enrolled into the program and about 80% of them are now reading at their expected grade&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>ESL&nbsp;Classes</p>
<p>Carley assisted the students to sign up with an e-mail provider. John, the teacher, sent assignments via e-mails. The students had to respond the same way. Students have developed skills in MS word, the Internet and a basic understanding of how computer works.   At least 15 students, so far, have developed a medium level of proficiency on MS&nbsp;Words.  </p>
<p>Thanks to Carley, Waite House English program obtained 15 on line licenses of Rosetta Stone English software for 2004-05. Carley took the initiative to search foundations and came across Rosetta’s foundation.  The Market value of these 15 licenses is approximately $1,900.00. Thank you&nbsp;Carley.</p>

                    <p>Marcia worked during the year to reorganize the task force/coordinating board of the Parsells and Denver Computer Technology Center.   She also coordinated with the Academy for Career Development, which provided computer software, support, and long-distance learning classes for neighborhood adults in basic computer skills. Marcia took several classes herself through the Academy to upgrade her skills and improve her ability to find volunteers for the center. Marcia worked throughout the year with neighborhood groups developing a website based on the needs of these groups, preparing a listserv for the community group, and working to improve communication among various committees and services in the community. Marcia attended meetings of the Youth/Adult Partnership grant, a capacity-building youth-serving grant from NY State, which worked to bring neighborhood groups together and work on youth-chosen activities. Marcia recruited, trained, scheduled, monitored, and evaluated volunteers for the CTC lab. Marcia worked with church members and other volunteers to maintain and expand outreach services to neighborhood youth and adults. Marcia worked on One Voice/One&nbsp;Vision.</p>
<p>Marcia worked with the local neighborhood organization, the Beechwood Organization, to set up a website and improve communication between individuals in the organization and members of the community. She sought input from various parts of the neighborhood and communicated effectively with the web designer and the president of the organization. She was always positive and friendly to the youth who attended the CTC lab. She was also encouraging to volunteers and&nbsp;supporters.</p>

                    <p>David has assisted TSN Coordinator with the procurement, development, distribution and evaluation of instructional materials for member&nbsp;sites.  </p>
<p>David has met with eligible sites independently and jointly with TSN coordinator as well as helped procure and disseminate information between sites and the TSN coordinator.  Because of David’s technical background and ability to grasp the complete picture he has resolved many problems and questions before they could become issues.  Once the financial issues are resolved, David will independently visit the Centers receiving equipment to ensure that its installation is complete and satisfies the Center’s requirements.  As a result of the David’s assistance the current round of hardware and furniture upgrades is ahead of last years&nbsp;pace. </p>
<p>David is serving as the Project Manager for the re-design of the website). Davis is coordinating the translation of a portion of the website into Spanish and is keeping the content of the web site up to date.  David frequently provides help desk support to members using the&nbsp;site. </p>
<p>David is currently serving as a fifth-grade group leader for the Kinetic City program. Kinetic City is a science-based program aligned with Boston Public School standards for grades 3-6 designed to be offered in out-of school time. David along with key staff from member sites will be trained to both run the program and sites as well as on how to train others to lead the program.  David will provide important feedback as we pilot this train-the-trainer program being developed jointly with MIT’s Kavli&nbsp;Institute.  </p>
<p>• David has developed and is maintaining two databases for managing the information needed for reporting to our funders—Boston Connects, Inc. and the Timothy Smith Fund. These databases track information for 40 sites, hundreds of classes, and thousands of&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>• David completed a series of classes at BNN TV’s Multimedia Center and used these new skills to video the recent Girls Get Connected Conference.  It is anticipated that he will turn this into a CD or DVD which can be used for publicity for upcoming conferences.  David will also use these skills to create a CD or DVD of success stories of individuCenter&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>I must take this opportunity to comment on David directly.  He demonstrates a level of maturity far beyond that which I have seen from others in his position.  His attention to detail and in depth-technical skills have has enabled him to successfully create and<br />
maintain the databases critical to the TSN’s daily operation.  David’s work ethic is outstanding—he is never late, he is never absent, he never complains, he is totally reliable.  If I give his something to get done he does it on time and accurately with a minimum of input, much less supervision.  David demonstrates real depth and breadth of perspective in meetings with funders, meeting with TS Center staff, and in meetings with the TSN Steering Committee.  Of particular note is the “business acumen” he applies to the TSN which he acquired through planning his business in&nbsp;Milwaukee.</p>

<p>•	Increase the sustainability of the Café through the development of a systematic volunteer recruitment approach and support mechanisms (orientation, job descriptions, training, reward system, etc.), so that it will continue to grow and thrive as a key resource for low-income persons to develop skills and gain access to&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>•	Public and private sector resources will enable the project to continue after the VISTA member leaves.  MATV/CTAC currently maintains a number of relationships with community agencies, volunteers, and businesses.  MATV/CTAC will maintain any new relationships the VISTA member develops that support the long-term success of this project.  This will include coordinating the VISTA member’s activities in relation to these groups’ programs and participation in the&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>Michelle’s main goals since joining the YMCA have been to work both with the YMCA programs and the wider community to increase the visibility and programming of the CyberY. She has not only created some resources, but has also placed a priority on using resources that already exist, so as to not recreate the&nbsp;wheel.</p>

                    <p>This has been an exciting year for our CTCNet VISTA here at the Durham Literacy Center.  Previous VISTAs have laid the framework for the progress that Brian Russell, this year’s VISTA, has made to date.  Overall, the VISTAs role is to (1) serve as technology integration specialist and oversee learning offerings, including:  PC Basics, ABE, GED, ESOL, Family Literacy and Career Passport; (2) provide web page maintenance and enhancement; and (3) develop technology volunteer&nbsp;plan.</p>

            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>The VISTA was responsible for maintaining and upgrading all of our agency’s computers and labs in addition to assisting in making agency-wide decisions as they pertained to technology.  By recruiting and supporting technical volunteers, Brian effectively juggled all of his duties.  Our VISTA provided excellent leadership as the co-chair of our ad-hoc tech committee and guided us through many important decisions regarding infrastructure, training and outreach.  Please see the 04-05 VISTA’s web-blog for details of some of the projects he worked on:  <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/" title="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/">http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/</a>.  However, only a few of his accomplishments are listed on his web log - the rest are highlighted&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.durhamliteracy.org" title="www.durhamliteracy.org">www.durhamliteracy.org</a> Website<br />
The VISTA provided superb research, advice, set-up, development and, ultimately, training to the full staff team on our new website.  After research, the VISTA recommended that we use a program called Civicspace.org, freeware with customizable authoring privileges and a straightforward authoring interface.  The new website has already attracted funders, individual donations, a multitude of volunteers and strengthened interaction with all of our stakeholders.  Each staff member has a blog and the ability to update content.   After the VISTA trained the staff on the basics of the webpage and setting policy, many staff have mastered the basics and have set up more features such as discussion forums for volunteers, calendaring and soon-to-be online&nbsp;forms. </p>
<p>IBM Grant Management<br />
As a beta testing site during this past fiscal year, Durham Literacy Center (DLC) English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) introduced the &#8220;Reading Recognition&#8221; program to approximately 130 students.   While there are still some rough spots in the early version of the application, many students indicated that &#8220;Reading Recognition&#8221; helped them improve their pronunciation, listening and&nbsp;reading.  </p>
<p>The VISTA coordinated volunteers to install 3 new computer labs at DLC and its partner-sites.  Work included installing software and setup on servers and clients, hardware setup.  The VISTA was instrumental in training staff, partners and end users on using the new computer lab and&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>Agency Policy Development<br />
The VISTA effectively researched and gained buy-in by staff and management on best practices for creating policies and procedures appropriate for a non-profit like the Durham Literacy Center.  The VISTA identified sample policies from other non-profits and counseled the management on policies to adopt.  These policies include, but are not limited to the following:<br />
•	Providing donations to partner agencies<br />
•	Laptop loans<br />
•	Use of the computer lab<br />
•	Website content and&nbsp;authoring</p>
<p>The Teen Career Academy<br />
The Teen Career Academy and the Duke Research Service Learning Project – The VISTA created a mobile lab using donated laptops.  The VISTA trained volunteers and teen students on how to use the GED interactive software program and others and tutored teens in the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Adult Literacy<br />
The VISTA participated in our volunteer training on the intensive reading instruction method called the Wilson Method.  From that point, Brian assisted in tutoring some adult literacy students and then led an in-service tutor training activity on the use of technology and in the initial pre-service tutor training&nbsp;session.</p>

                    <p>The Durham Literacy Center is very appreciative of the assistance and contributions that the Digital Arts Service Corps has provided to our partners and us.  Last year, 2004-2005, we were lucky to have a VISTA as knowledgeable and experienced as Brian Russell.  The VISTA took our agency to a new level – our technical infrastructure, integrity and our presentation to the outside world via the webpage are all at the strongest point they have been in&nbsp;years.</p>
