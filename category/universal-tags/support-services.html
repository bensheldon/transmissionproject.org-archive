                    <p>Laura’s year with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE) was characterized by a continued maturing of the of the project, both in its partnerships with area schools and its facility with linking MoLLIE efforts to the area mandated curriculum. Relationships that were begun with area teachers in our first two years of operation continued and thrived. Those teachers that utilized MoLLIe in the first year actively promoted the MoLLIE project to their colleagues leading in turn, to an expanded clientele of teachers in a broader selection of&nbsp;schools.</p>
<p>Further relationships developed that Laura was crucial to: In conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice “Project Safe Neighborhoods” (PSN) program, Laura facilitated the efforts of local youths at neighborhood associations and community centers in writing, shooting, performing, and editing their own Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on the subject of gun violence prevention. Another partnership that developed this year in which Laura played a key role was a six month project with Wedgwood Christian Services of West Michigan. Similar to PSN, the Wedgwood project involved providing at-risk teens with the tools, training, and means of transmission to create their own mini documentaries and PSAs focusing on substance abuse prevention. Laura demonstrated a particular facility in getting young women to open up and tell their personal stories in a manner that they might not with male&nbsp;trainer/technicians.</p>
<p>Laura’s final, and perhaps most lasting project, done in conjunction with VISTA volunteer Nate Diedrich, has been the production of an eight-episode instructional module series on the MoLLIE method of video&nbsp;production.</p>
<p>Laura Craig went on to work full-time at Portland Community Media in Portland, Oregon, where she supervised the work of Digital Arts Corps Member Nickey&nbsp;Robare.</p>

<p>Founded in 1991, LIHI has grown to be one of the most productive affordable housing developers in the Northwest. LIHI owns and/or manages over 1,700 housing units at 50 sites in six counties throughout the Puget Sound region. Eighty percent of LIHI housing is reserved for households earning less than 30 percent of the area median household&nbsp;income.</p>
<p>LIHI provides a variety of supportive services to help residents maintain their housing and develop self-sufficiency. Our efforts include providing residents with case management, life skills training, technology access and training, financial literacy training and savings programs, and activities for some of the more than 500 children in LIHI&nbsp;housing.</p>
<p>LIHI also owns and operates the Urban Rest Stop, a much-needed hygiene facility for homeless individuals and families located in downtown Seattle, serves approximately 5,000 unduplicated individuals each year. The URS is designed to serve a wide range of people including homeless adults, families with children, youth and the elderly. Urban Rest Stop patrons include disabled persons, veterans, non-English-speaking individuals and people of&nbsp;color.</p>
<p>LIHI believes that affordable housing does not mean poor quality housing. We believe that innovative partnerships, creative project development and sustainable design features in affordable housing makes for a healthy, strong, and committed&nbsp;community.</p>

                    <p>The Mission of the MAAC Project is to promote self-sufficiency for low and moderate income families and communities of Southern California through advocacy for, and delivery of, social, educational, housing and employment&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>MAAC will pursue our mission by offering the various communities in San Diego County a helping hand, by bridging the path to self-sufficiency, and by building and enhancing&nbsp;self-esteem.</p>
<p>About&nbsp;MAAC</p>
<p>The MAAC Project is a multi-purpose social service agency with a successful 45 year history of serving various communities throughout San Diego County. In 1965, MAAC Project opened its doors to serve San Diego&#8217;s disadvantaged. One million clients later, MAAC is still acting as a catalyst to help individuals and families become self-sufficient. MAAC provides a spectrum of unique programs designed to assist clients by engaging them in the enhancement of their own lives through lifestyle changes. The programs strive to improve clients’ economic standing as well as their ability to access resources available to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>As one of the most successful social service agencies in the county, MAAC has continuously assisted low-income clients in achieving a higher level of self-sufficiency. Our clients want what everyone wants, a sense of security, viability and self-reliance. MAAC exists to help them achieve&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>MAAC serves over 35,000 individuals per year and over the past 43 years has touched the lives of over 1,000,000 clients. Employing over 300 personnel, MAAC staffs 35 sites bringing to its constituents empowering social services, health components, a state of arts charter school, technology centers, economic development, affordable housing&#8230;building community. MAAC maintains and continues to instill in every program under its umbrella the object of its mission…the achievement of self-esteem and&nbsp;self-sufficiency. </p>
<p>MAAC has become one of San Diego&#8217;s most distinguished and comprehensive social service agencies. MAAC serves San Diego County families through HeadStart/FirstStart, nutritional programs, low-income home weatherization and improvement, two notable and culturally specific recovery homes, award winning affordable housing complexes and a charter&nbsp;school.</p>
<p>The availability of secure and attractive homes and the development of a community, which provides access to childcare, pre-school, recreational activities, computer training, job referrals, and services designed to enhance the livability and viability of the neighborhood, builds pride and self-respect. In turn, this leads to self-development, respect for others, and citizenship participation. These are MAAC&#8217;s goals. This is the path and direction on which MAAC has&nbsp;embarked.</p>
