Over 60 youth  signed up for this program. With the leadership, coordination and facilitation skills of our VISTA volunteer, Nikki Payne, youth in the program are learning skills for movie making, web design and other digital media&nbsp;tools.</p>

The lab activities are coordinated by Nikki Payne, Americorps VISTA volunteer. It is expected that this number will double by the end of the program year, in&nbsp;August.</p>
<p>With a digital media grant obtained through one of our volunteers during our work with Katrina evacuees, Nikki studied digital media programs in Ecuador, Argentina and Chile. Nikki returned with curriculum and digital media best practices for distribution to other community technology centers in&nbsp;Houston.</p>

                    <p>In the past six months, OLLIE has provided digital media training to over 150 youth through 17 projects at 11 community locations.  In addition, OLLIE has scheduled projects to serve an additional 180 youth over the next six months.  Each round of OLLIE projects has balanced new and returning community partners.  Our VISTA has served as a group coordinator for many of these sites, facilitating communication between the OLLIE staff and volunteers, the OLLIE coordinator, and community partners.  Ryn has also begun to identify volunteers to support this project.  He identified the post-production talents of a community partner and utilized them to finish a student&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>In addition, OLLIE&#8217;s curriculum design has evolved.  Based on participant feedback, trainer input, and research into youth media best practices; the teaching methods, practice exercises, and time allotments for each segment of production have changed to better serve the youth we work with.   Ryn&#8217;s insights about classroom teaching experiences and research into youth media curriculum are of great value to this process.  I am looking forward to further utilizing Ryn&#8217;s expertise to design and implement our summer intensive &#8220;Adventures in Television&#8221;sessions.  He is one of the leads for this&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>A very exciting part of OLLIE&#8217;s evolution is the creation and implementation of a graphic design identity package.  Ryn has served as a lead contact in the process of recruiting and hiring a designer, developing a logo, and working with vendors.  Currently Ryn is leading efforts to develop and refine copy that will promote the program in print, web, and video materials.  Ryn also was able to develop his web design skills to create a first draft of a website for OLLIE: <a href="http://www.ollietv.org" title="www.ollietv.org">www.ollietv.org</a>.  Behind the scenes, he has created extensive outlines for future implementations of a site that will be useful to project staff, community partners, and program&nbsp;participants.</p>

                    <p>An amazing thing about Ryn is the way in which he integrated himself into the media center community.  He put himself &#8216;out there&#8217; as willing to help, learn, and volunteer on his own time to help others and make the media center a better place.  He has organized the staff on more than one occasion to attend cultural events and support each other.  He is an exceptional asset to the Oregon Learning Lab for Information&nbsp;Education.</p>

                    <p>Dean has been very attentive and invested in our mission and our work. He has built a strong base of support with teachers and administrators at the Social Justice Academy. This has allowed the school to build our program into their after school program and to help to build the connections with teachers that is needed to truly customize our work with young people during after school. This is a very important&nbsp;contribution.</p>
<p>This year we had a number of major accomplishments including establishing a new media lab at the Social Justice Academy and a new media and technology curriculum called Mosaic at the Social Justice Academy that uses storytelling to connect different academic disciplines. Mosaic started as an after school program and was so well received that students were given academic credit for their participation. Eight students completed the curriculum. Dean worked extensively on the Mosaic Curriculum and did outreach at the school by making &#8221; Mosaic&#8221; presentations in classes during regular school hours. Dean also was in charge of our e-newsletter and built the circulation from 1,000 to nearly&nbsp;4,000.</p>

                    <p>Over the past year, our VISTA has helped us bring ScienceQuest (an after-school science education program for young adolescents) to more communities, resulting in our reaching over sixty different community organizations over the last three years.  Our project provides under-served, under-represented young adolescents with the opportunity to explore science in an informal, after-school setting.  ScienceQuest provides organizations with a research-based plan designed to inspire enthusiasm for and curiosity in the sciences as well as training, technical support, web development tools, web hosting, and advice on teaching and science&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>Summary of&nbsp;Goals</p>
<p>- Create a youth-friendly website<br />
- coach two teams<br />
- create promotional materials for CTCNet&nbsp;conference</p>

                    <p>Our VISTA, Caitlin Feeley, made significant contributions to our work.  She created a youth-friendly ScienceQuest website including original graphics and content, and strived to keep the site accessible through engaging, youth-appropriate writing and valid HTML.  She coached two ScienceQuest teams this year, helping students create their own projects on topics ranging from space to chemical reactions to the laws of motion.  She produced and edited a digital video that we used to introduce our program to new coaches and coordinators at the 2004 CTCNet conference in Seattle. In addition to these major projects, Caitlin also provided day-to-day support for ScienceQuest by updating and maintaining our website, providing technical and other support to coaches and coordinators, writing correspondence, manuals, reports, and other materials, managing our listserv, and other administrative duties.

                    <p>The main goal of the Fuel Cell education initiative at the South End technology Center is to promote access and to expose the youth, at an early age, to science and cutting-edge technologies. Our goal is to grant access of new technologies to students of color that make up 85% of Boston school‚Äôs population and are frequently left behind. We want to bring the youth from behind and position them at the front end of this emerging technology and into the environmental issues that are significant in our society&nbsp;today.  </p>
<p>The fuel cell education program is working on three different fronts to reach this&nbsp;goal: </p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Primarily, we are aiming to work closely with educational institutions such as the Boston Renaissance Charter School and the Boston Public Schools to develop and implement a fuel cell technology unit for the middle school students. The idea is to promote a change in their awareness of the technology, and create access to a broader number of students throughout the school&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	The program also exposes the children attending the SETC to this forefront technology. The fuel cell is considered one of the most promising energy technologies of the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	In addition, we are attempting to reach the broader community and make them aware of fuel cell technology and its potential by participating in the AltWheels Festival (alternative transportation festival). We will be exhibiting fuel cell car models and talking about the technology and its potential to the general&nbsp;public.</p>

                    <p>Angela&#8217;s accomplishments included the development of a 100- page curriculum unit that included a Teacher‚Äôs Guide and a Student‚Äôs Guide for middle school students (8th grade level) on hydrogen fuel cells and engineering design technologies. The development of the curriculum unit was the stepping stone to establishing stronger relationships with institutions such as the Boston Renaissance Charter School, the Boston Public Schools, and the Roxbury Community&nbsp;College.</p>
<p>The development of this curriculum unit was just the start of several initiatives designed to share the knowledge of this technology with students, teachers and young adults. Angela had the opportunity to teach the unit to an after school class with students enrolled at the New Beginners after school program at Roxbury Community College (RCC). The after school program reinforces environmental technology education at the community level, where students from 13 to 16 years old learn about clean energy&nbsp;technology.</p>

                    <p>Brittney teaches the Community Health Worker (CHW) Class. (The CHWs are paid interns, often former clients, who are usually hired as staff at HPP after they finish their internship.)  She has created a dynamic and engaging curriculum for the CHW&nbsp;class. </p>
<p>Brittney also gives private weekly staff tutoring as well as ongoing staff tech&nbsp;support. </p>
<p>During open lab drop-in hours every afternoon, Brittney offers housing and job search support for&nbsp;clients. </p>
<p>Brittney is also in charge of maintaining our websites, and our organization wide forms system. She was put in charge of the phones, created a phone user guide and manages new staff phone&nbsp;needs. </p>
<p>Brittney is active in writing policy and long-term planning, including helping in the hiring process of the new Technology&nbsp;Manger. </p>
<p>Another large project that Brittney has taken on gracefully is overseeing the ailing database, which has not been able to handle our staffs&#8217; needs. She is working as the intermediary between staff, consultants and database programmers and is working to prepare HPP for a new database&nbsp;system.</p>

                    <p>Our Computers in the Home Project has sustained itself and continues to continue as planned due to the service of our VISTA.  Becky has helped  coordinate our program‚Äôs operations with volunteers and participants.  She has helped developed some manuals and curriculum that are helping our staff and volunteers to better operate the program in to the future.  Becky has had good success in ensuring that the classes are successfully run and has helped coordinate over 60 classes over the course of the year.  Her work has gotten us closer to reaching our goal of providing 300 computers to families.  Her service has greatly helped us grow our capacity as we successfully opened a second computer lab in May and allowed us to serve more than 600 participants in the&nbsp;program.</p>
