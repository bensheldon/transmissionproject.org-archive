                    <p>The WTA is establishing a community technology center (CTC) for the homeless as the CCNV shelter.  It provides technology access and training programs for the shelter population, as well as other disadvantaged populations utilizing it.  The VISTA member will train the homeless, then cultivate them to become full-time volunteers at the&nbsp;center. </p>
<p>These trained volunteers will build a self-sustaining service-learning model where trained members of the homeless community gain work-based learning experiences by performing vital technology repair and training services for local non-profit organizations and government agencies.  Small fees will be charged, just enough to self-sustain the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Phase I: Train the VISTA member in WTA service-learning performance tasks (see above).  The VISTA member spends a period of time pacticing these skills by training many members of the homeless community in the CCNV in&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Phase II:  Provide the homeless with professional technology job experience by operating a real high-tech company.   The VISTA member will be trained in the WTA Enterprise Curriculum and will use it to train and support advanced volunteers from the shelter in performing technology service-learning for the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Phase III: Armed with job experience provided in Phase II, service-learning volunteers have a better chance to obtain technology employment or to open their own firms. For a very small group of homeless having the skill set yet lacking the resources and confidence to start their own firms, the WTA and CCNV will provide desk space and the VISTA member will train and support them so they can open their own technology firms in the WTA/CCNV&nbsp;building.</p>

<p>Tony single-handedly landed a 200 computer donation from AARP, which will be distributed across the&nbsp;region.</p>
<p>Tony rebuilt two technology access labs in the shelter, providing technology access for 1300&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Implemented three sets of 12 week training classes for shelter residents. These included:<br />
1. MS Word<br />
2. MS Excel<br />
3. Introduction to Computers<br />
4. Computer&nbsp;refurbishing</p>
<p>Tony refurbished enough laptop computers to award to every homeless graduate of the 12 week training&nbsp;sessions.</p>
<p>Tony began building an eBay ecommerse training class so homeless can start selling on&nbsp;eBay.</p>
<p>Tony began building a city-wide computer recycling program and assisted in writing a proposal that was submitted to federal GSA and the District of Columbia to have homeless people manage their recyclable&nbsp;electronics.</p>
<p>Managed the writing of 5 grants to five agencies. All writing was done by homeless&nbsp;people.</p>

                    <p>Ray was responsible for managing our computer refurbishing lab, including creating a training program for refurbishing volunteers, researching an inventory system, developing and leading technology workshops for our students. While his work in the refurb lab was very valuable, his most significant accomplishment, and the one that was the biggest benefit to our organization, was the workshops he developed for our technology&nbsp;center.</p>

                    <p>Ray spent the year coming up with ideas for the workshops, creating the materials necessary to lead the workshops, and organizing the instructors of the workshops. Workshop topics included digital storytelling, silent movie-making, audio dubbing, and 3D imaging.  Ray learned how create (and advertise) workshops that are appealing to teens and eventually had regular attendance at them.   Students in our program earn a free computer system to take home. Our policy states that if they attend 5 workshops, they&#8217;ll earn enough extra credit to earn a year of free internet access at home. While nearly all of our students earn the home computer, many students weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of the free internet since they weren&#8217;t getting the opportunity to attend workshops. With Ray&#8217;s help, a great number of students were able to attend the workshops that are required in order to earn home internet. While having a home computer is valuable to our students, without internet they remain at a disadvantage when it comes to completing homework and projects for&nbsp;school. </p>
<p>Now that Ray&#8217;s term has ended we are happy to have a whole library of workshop ideas and materials at the ready. Because everything has already been developed, it is much easier for us to recruit volunteers to lead our workshops, since it no longer requires a significant time commitment on their part. We are pleased that we were able to, and will be able to continue to, offer so many workshops to our students and that they may earn internet access at&nbsp;home.</p>

                    <p>Diana has posted over 1,200 services on 4People.org and has been instrumental in helping the database to grow and advance. She has also designed marketing materials, learned to build computers, trained people on computers, written documents, designed web pages, and done lots of editing. With her help, RECA and 4People are advancing at an amazing&nbsp;pace.</p>
<p>At the six month level Diana has completed a great deal of work towards populating the 4people.org database, which includes youth, seniors and family community services.  She has developed a web page for another non-profit (Catholic Family and Child Services), and taught a class on beginning web page design. By posting services to 4People and continually improving the database, Diana is helping our online database become a viable community resource. We currently have over 4,300 services listed in Eastern Washington, largely thanks to her efforts and the efforts of the VISTA that preceded her. Diana has been instrumental in helping to design the front end interface of 4People to be first time user friendly.  See&nbsp;4people.tcfn.org.</p>

                    <p>Progress has been made in the attendance of children and adults in the CTC&#8217;s maintained for Ed West. At the end of August, we had a 20% increase of children arriving after school to do their homework or just surf on the net since February. We have also made an increase of adult attendance in the courses we held. We have had at least 100 certificates to give to the graduates from our beginner&#8217;s computer courses. Our adults have learned the basics of Microsoft Office and Windows. They have even learned how to search for jobs and build perfect resumes. We have given away at least 50 computers in the last six months to MA Rehab clients and also students that have taken our courses. Donations were made regular by major companies and by individuals who wanted to give to our community. I have also updated all 30 computers with new software that was used by all participants. Especially learning tools for the&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>Part of Paul’s job was the development of a lesson plan to teach residents the basics of computers.  Paul was to create a lesson plan for 6 or 8 week classes that would engage residents with a completion date set, and a new class to begin subsequently.  This did not happen as planned and the one class that has met is still meeting after 12 weeks, with the same four students and no set plan to end.  Paul is not supposed to be teaching directly, but it was allowed assuming that new volunteers were being sought to step in to teach.  With very little success in recruiting and maintaining volunteers Paul chose to teach classes directly, in an effort to get the computer center&nbsp;utilized.</p>

                    <p>Charlena helped to launched the new website in September 2002.  It has been extremely helpful with fundraising and the recruitment of volunteers. Microsoft Access was used to create databases to track software, hardware, community and technology contacts, and student, tutor, and parent contacts.  Each database has easy-to-use interfaces to update&nbsp;information. </p>
<p>Charlena created FOTS curricular resource binders based off of resources from Byte Back, SeniorNet, Triangle Coalition, Digital Newsroom, and a host of web-based programs.  As a result, the FOTS curriculum is a pool of resources that can be manipulated and adapted to student need and class environment.  Future VISTAS can rely on the curriculum binders and documented resources to create future&nbsp;classes.</p>
<p>Charlena assisted in keeping the computer center operated on a five-day week schedule.  Basic computer literacy skills were addressed in computer classes and Open Lab.  In the spring of 2003, classes concentrated on more advanced topics such as Lego robotics, Photoshop, spreadsheets, and web page&nbsp;design.</p>

                    <p>This year has been successful, for we conducted the following classes here at the Riley Hill Technology Center:  Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, as well as Introduction to the personal computer. The total number of students attending was 54. As Ella says, “I was blessed with seven volunteer instructors by advertising in the community. I was also privileged to teach Microsoft Word with an Introduction to the Personal&nbsp;Computer.”</p>
<p>A Computer Repair course was developed for Riley Hill Community Technology Center. Ella decided to use two resources to develop this course: Computer Concepts (Third Edition) and Technology for Social Change&#8217;s curriculum (<a href="http://www.tecschange.org" title="www.tecschange.org">www.tecschange.org</a>) with their permission. Ella also planned to use the RTPnet site as a reference for this&nbsp;course.</p>

                    <p>Developing this course has helped Ella to better troubleshoot computers, for there are individuals in the community that are in dire need of help.  These individuals bring their personal computers to the center for technical support. In the Wendell Community and surrounding areas, the Riley Hill Technology Center is the only source that does not charge a fee for&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>We very grateful to add our source of Volunteers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Technology Resources. We have used the following sources this year&nbsp;(2003-2004):</p>
<p>•	Schools (K-12) students as well as other personnel<br />
•	Community Colleges<br />
•	Libraries (Public and Other)<br />
•	Local businesses<br />
•	Wake Forest Pediatrics (Wake Forest, NC)<br />
•	Churches (Wakefield, Zebulon First Baptist etc.)<br />
•	RTP.net (Website)<br />
•	Family and Friends of staff members<br />
•	Department of Social Services (Eastern Regional Center, Zebulon)<br />
•	Retired Senior&nbsp;citizens</p>
<p>The quality of life has improved for the youth and adults who have taken computer classes at the center, however updating the computer equipment as well as software is still needed. We are currently looking for funding for this project and for a long-term way of sustaining the center.  The Riley Hill Survey Plan has given some insight on how to get this plan&nbsp;implemented.</p>

She is very dependable, very cooperative, a team player, and continues to be an asset to the Riley Hill Community. Her interaction with others (peers, youth, students, etc.) is outstanding. During this time period, there have not been any negative comments received regarding Ella. To sum it up, I would rate her as &#8216;Consistently Exceeds&#8217; the requirements in all aspects of the job.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>The Marcus A. Foster Educational Institute (MAFEI) Oakland Technology Exchange West project (OTX-W) is a large-scale computer reuse program dedicated to providing high quality, refurbished home computers to families, students and teachers.  As reflected in the scope of work and subsequent MOU agreement, MAFEI continues to meet the following objectives for FY&nbsp;2004-05.</p>
<p>OTX-West is dedicated to eliminating the digital divide in Oakland, California. We do this by refurbishing surplus computers, educating families and providing ongoing access and support to those who have received our computers. The experiences of OTX-West over the past 6 years has demonstrated both the need for home computers in the community and the reuse model as a green way to meet the&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, everyone needs access to computers and the Internet in order to join the new economy. Access to education, health care, government agencies, jobs, and other services are all currently offered through the Internet. This need has many adults feeling like they are too old to learn the tools of the &#8220;information age.&#8221; This way of thinking, along with the lack of resources in the communities, contributes to the &#8220;digital divide&#8221; that exits in&nbsp;Oakland.</p>
<p>It is not enough to provide computers, although this is essential. OTX-West provides education that is necessary for those who are getting their computers for the first time.
