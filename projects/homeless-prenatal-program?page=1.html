                    <p>With the strain of funding for human resources this year and state of the economy, HPP is serving more and more clients but unfortunately cannot increase the number of staff to maintain the same quality of care. HPP is looking to grow its volunteer programs and futher engage long-time, regular volunteers in order to continue providing vital services for its clients. This key objective of the most recent strategic plan developed by the Executive Director and Board sets the goal at increasing volunteer participation by&nbsp;50%.</p>
<p>Rather than cut client services that have no staff to run the program, HPP seeks an Americorps VISTA to grow our new Community Technology Center (CTC) volunteer program and revitalize the CTC&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>The CTC is both under-utilized by clients and somewhat neglected by the IT team, who have very little time allocated to CTC support or organizing volunteers to help. Clients who have little computer knowledge are helpless during unattended hours, and will unlikely return after a frustrating visit. During well-supported CTC hours, client attendance skyrockets. When the CTC is not well-supported, client attendance&nbsp;plummets.</p>
<p>While the IT staff has had some success in utilizing volunteers, the program lacks organization and infrastructure to be successful and sustainable. CTC volunteers are much more specialized than regular volunteers, requiring more training and committment, and while the program remains unorganized, cannot be managed by the general HPP Volunteer&nbsp;Coordinator.</p>
<p>The VISTA will organize, oversee, and train a team of volunteers who will assist clients during open lab hours, provide one-on-one support with resume and cover letter writing, and teach workshops ranging from basic computer skills to exciting digital media&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>By creating a thriving, collaborative community of CTC volunteers, the training aspect of the program will be virtually self-sustaining by utilizing both senior volunteers and free general training from CTN Bay Area. Volunteer coordination could also be supported by a leading volunteer in conjunction with the general HPP Volunteer&nbsp;Coordinator.</p>
<p>A well-organized CTC Volunteer Program will be transitioned to the general HPP Volunteer Coordinator after the departure of the VISTA, who will be better prepared to maintain the program. If additional resources are still required, proposing additional hires will be more viable with an organized, successful&nbsp;program.</p>

<p>With direction from the project manager and Development Director, the VISTA will develop creative methods for collecting the many stories of need, perseverance and success that buzz around our client programs and are the pride of our client services staff. The VISTA will gather these stories, in addition to news and events about the agency, and distribute the information to the community through a variety of&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p>Goal 1: Drive traffic to Web site and convert visitors into members, volunteers and&nbsp;advocates</p>
<p>Goal 2: Create sustainable process for content gathering and distribution at&nbsp;HPP</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Scott worked with mentor Brittney Fosbrook to create an ongoing, nearly self-sustainable strategic plans for a volunteer-run program in our Community Technology Center. Scott created an online volunteer guide which contains all the &#8220;how to&#8217;s&#8221; and useful links for our volunteers.The guide also contains volunteers agreements and lab rules. Scott also worked with our Systems Administrator to create customized, bilingual computer profiles for our clients, making it easier for our guests to login and use the lab with minimal computer experience. Scott also cleaned up the space physically, getting rid of unused materials and installing useful information sheets for additional resources. In addition to volunteer outreach, Scott also conducted major outreach to clients and to our case management staff, so that they understand the resources available and their potential value to&nbsp;clients.</p>
<p>The volunteer program in the CTC has been successful in that it has increased lab attendance, increased volunteer engagement, and has decreased the amount of staff time necessary to run the lab. However, the CTC is not able to self-sustain on volunteers alone. Scott has been hired as a full-time employee, with half-time duties related to CTC&nbsp;coordination.</p>
<p>Scott was a key player in HPP&#8217;s first steps in social media, creating a Facebook and Twitter presence, as well as advising the development of our revamped website. This developed as the need was identified at HPP and matched Scott&#8217;s skills and&nbsp;interests.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>The Americorps VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and piloting a technology class for our English speaking clients, the majority of whom are African-American. The goal is to motivate women from the HPP&#8217;s English speaking support groups to avail themselves of the resources in the computer lab.  To reinforce and extend the class experience, the Americorps*VISTA will create a weblog specifically for these clients where they can share their interests, issues, questions and accomplishments. The weblog community will serve as an additional support group to these parents as they seek ways out of poverty. Through participation in classes, one-on-one instruction, and the weblog, these clients will upgrade their job and communication&nbsp;skills.</p>
<p>Our 2004-2005 VISTA developed a community web-site for homeless families and families in jeopardy of becoming homeless.  This website is fast becoming a vital resource to such families and to case managers throughout the region for instant access to resource information.    This years Americorps VISTA would expand the use of the website by (1) developing a workshop to introduce the website to new users, both clients and case managers,  (2) develop promotional materials such as email announcements and posters, and (3) work with other volunteers to develop a separate homepage, navigation system and additional features just for case&nbsp;managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and coordinating a staff development program in the CTC. Since one of the best practices for strengthening a program such as ours is to invest in our case workers, we are planning to use the CTC for more staff development than in previous years.  We will develop an on-line assessment tool to establish a baseline of the technology skills of all staff members. Using this data we will develop and coordinate skill set workshops tailored to staff needs that will be held in the&nbsp;CTC.  </p>
<p>To strengthen and  expand our job readiness program the Americorps*VISTA will be responsible for developing 5  In order to do this the VISTA will identify, contact and visit appropriate educational and vocational training programs.  In addition the VISTA will develop referral protocols between these programs and HPP Case&nbsp;Managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer will also coordinate our &#8220;Computers in the Home&#8221; Project. This project takes our capacity to give technological skills and experience to the underserved population beyond the walls of our CTC. Funded to provide 40 families with refurbished computers and in-home tech support through ReliaTech, a social venture project of StreetTech of Richmond, CA., participants receive training and, upon completion of the training, computers and periodic in-home tech support. In addition, clients who have received computers for their homes continue to receive training at the HPP&#8217;s&nbsp;CTC. </p>
<p>Finally, the Americorps*VISTA will collaborate with our partners in the Community Connectivity Collaboration (One Economy, StreetTech, ReliaTech, Canal Alliance, TechFutures), a group formed to define needs of local CTC&#8217;s and find ways to seek funding. The VISTA will attend CCC meetings and other partnering events that may&nbsp;develop.</p>

As her supervisor in the Community Technology Center it has been my pleasure to work very closely with her for the last 12 months. She is highly committed, intelligent, and industrious. She is extremely productive and always looking for new projects. She is also very personable, able to interact warmly with the diverse groups of people who work in our program and who come here for services. We are very lucky that she has stayed on at HPP as a part-time employee while she attends graduate school in San&nbsp;Francisco.  </p>
<p>Ellen&#8217;s duties at HPP have included maintaining two websites, teaching technology in English and in Spanish, maintaining and developing the client database on Microsft Access, as well as trouble shooting technology problems in the lab and at staff workstations. She has worked with the local cable television access station to create PSAs and informational programming. In addition she has created an online generator for our paper forms which allows staff to print forms on an as needed basis from their own computers. She has also designed and published agency literature and signage in english and in&nbsp;spanish.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>From the beginning of her placement Yvette has improved the efficiency and the quality of services delivered to clients of the HPP Technology Center. Yvette has a quiet strength that clients and staff respect and admire. This trait has enabled Yvette to work well with all of the clients of the Technology Center (homeless and formerly homeless families) and with the&nbsp;staff. </p>
<p>Yvette’s work has increased the sustainability of the HPP Technology Center. She has assisted in formalizing HPP’s technology training curriculum for staff and clients. Her work on connecting HPP with educational and vocation al programs in the Bay Area will be enable HPP staff to assist clients in becoming self sufficient. Her excellent work on the resource website for homeless families in San Francisco will enable families and service providers to connect with needed&nbsp;resources. </p>
<p>Yvette managed a team of students from the University of San Francisco to create a resource website for homeless families called <a href="http://www.helping-sf.org">www.helping-sf.org</a>. Yvette met with homeless families, service providers and staff at the Homeless Prenatal Program to ensure the relevance of the site content. She continues to update the site to guarantee that the material is up to date. She has already received praise from staff at San Francisco&#8217;s Department of Human Services and from homeless family service providers. I was recently at a conference were an Executive Director of CTC referenced helping-sf.org as a model to be replicated throughout the Bay&nbsp;Area.</p>

Without this dedicated VISTA member the HPP Technology Center would not be able to live up to its potential. The technology center under Yvette has flourished and increased the access to technology for numerous homeless and low income&nbsp;families.</p>

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
