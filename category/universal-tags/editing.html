                    <p>CDS has on archive over 6000 digital stories, the largest archive of digital stories in the world representing 16 years of work, and we continue to capture as a national/international organization more than 800 stories per year. The archival system has evolved slowly over the last decade, we can identify the location of the vast majority of stories by the workshop name and date, but we lack a robust system of managing the stories based on meta-data tags and client name. To secure the archive for future generations we need to maintain a robust system, and enhance its capabilities. The capacity to fully integrate effective archival practices into all of our workshops and post-production processes is an invaluable contribution to the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>We are seeking a CTCVISTA member to help develop our Archive and Post Production Technical Support systems. This work would include:<br />
Reviewing existing archive project and systems, research comparable systems in other organizations: enhancing and developing database systems for our movie archive; enhancing and developing post-production systems for managing participant data, update materials for post production process and software tutorials, DVD and Website templates for publication; developing model research/curatorial projects for each initiative process using archive as basis for examining relevant issues in connection to&nbsp;poverty.</p>
<p>The CTC Vista will work with the Supervisor/Technical Director to further develop and enhance two major systems of our organization, the CDS story archive and CDS Post-Production&nbsp;system</p>
<p>The tasks will include:<br />
1. Review existing archive project and systems, research comparable systems in other organizations<br />
2. Enhance and develop database systems for our movie archive.<br />
3. Enhance and develop post-production systems for managing participant data<br />
4. Develop model research/curatorial projects for each initiative process using archive as basis for examining relevant issues in connection to&nbsp;poverty.</p>

                    <p>Prometheus has always done work to make the workings of the FCC more transparent and to bring a wider array of voices to the table as the FCC considers the media future. A VISTA will allow the organization to reorganize this often harried work into a more systematic operation for&nbsp;Prometheus. </p>
<p>The regulatory research project involves researching legal and technical issues as they relate to communications regulations, for the purpose of informing regulatory rule-makings. This would include topics such as Low Power radio, media ownership, spectrum policy, and the analog to digital&nbsp;transition.</p>
<p>Goal 1: Make FCC regulations and lawsuits relevant to media reform accessible to a broad&nbsp;audience </p>
<p>Goal 2: Prepare outreach plan for future FCC filing&nbsp;windows</p>

                    <p>Goal #1 for our second VISTA was to “Make FCC regulations and lawsuits relevant to media reform accessible to a broad audience.” Brandy Doyle has developed a working knowledge of FCC regulations and telecommunications law that she’s used to educate both the general public and other staff members on the rules that impact community radio. She has written a number of brief, plain-English articles about complex regulatory subjects, including digital radio, radio spectrum policy, and broadcast media ownership. Brandy led the effort to develop a comprehensive plan for the organization&#8217;s regulatory work, including a 20+ page document on regulatory work – the most comprehensive the organization has ever produced. This plan proved instrumental gathering input from the entire staff collective in decisions about future regulatory priorities. As part of her goal to make regulatory procedures more accessible, Brandy designed and led a series of public workshops in different settings. In April Brandy held an educational workshop at WMNF Community Radio in Tampa, Florida on media ownership and FCC rulemaking process. In May, Brandy co-presented on “Community Journalism: Its Relevance in Radio and How to Bring it to your Newsroom” with Terri Klemetson, news director at KMUD, and co-presented &#8220;The D.C. Report: Community Radio, Politics And Policy&#8221; with Pete Tridish at Grassroots Radio Conference. Also in May, she facilitated a discussion with Davis Media Access about the challenges and benefits of community radio/public access television partnerships. Brandy has been aided by her coworkers in the regulatory policy team who have taught her how to research FCC dockets and given her context and information to make sense of them. She has also received support from the rest of the&nbsp;staff.</p>
<p>Because of her own interests, skills, and experience, Brandy has chosen to taken on a number of general writing and editing projects for the organization. Brandy has worked with the communications staff to think through a more comprehensive press strategy, not just a press strategy for outreach, as described in her VISTA assignment, and has played a role in improving our process for media advisories and press releases. Another responsibility Brandy has taken on has been to help coordinate aspects of our new website launch. She’s also taken on responsibility for responding to requests to volunteer at Prometheus, a role that rotates amongst collective&nbsp;members.</p>

                    <p>A VISTA will help coordinate the variety of content that supports the CTC VISTA Project and that the Project produces for the community media and technology fields. This position provides an excellent environment in which to develop professional editorial skills in various media. This VISTA will serve as Assistant Editor of the Community Technology&nbsp;Review</p>
<p>As specified in this year&#8217;s project basics (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm</a>), all organizations participating in the VISTA Project will be required to do some work in one of four areas (community networking, community organizing, technology assistance to nonprofits, and digital media for youth). Nationally known experts will be coordinating each of these areas. The Curriculum Coordinator will work with these experts to develop curricular material to be used for people with interest these areas and for the College&#8217;s Community Media and Technology&nbsp;program.</p>

                    <p>In her capacity as Assistant Editor of &#8220;The Community Technology Review&#8221; (<a href="http://www.comtechreview.org" title="www.comtechreview.org">www.comtechreview.org</a>), Danielle ably undertook a wide range of responsibilities including taking over the reins from the previous Associated Editor and completing all organizing and author communication already in the works, coordinating sections and writing a substantial number of articles for the fall issue.  She oversaw the development and production of the online version, dealt with university printing services in arranging for hard copy printings, and did author/contributor follow-up. Following this, she was helpfully involved in working with the Advisory Committee in undertaking future planning, and when the decision was made for the publication to go on hiatus and be replaced in the interim with the Project newsletter/report, she accepted oversight responsibility and published the first issue (see <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters</a>) in its entirety.  She has followed this up with taking primary responsbility for planning future issues for the remainder of the project year, including coordination with the Priority Area Coordinator materials, as that dovetails and integrates with her work with them in developing curricular material for the project that can be integrated with the College&#8217;s Community Media and Technology Program (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt</a>).  In addition to these things, she has proved to be a key and invaluable member of the project leadership team at office&nbsp;headquarters.</p>
<p>Danielle serves as liason between the Community Media and Technology Program curriculum building efforts and the VISTA project&#8217;s content focused learning groups. She has been extremely effective in working with faculty in curriculum design, making real connections between the field work of the VISTA&#8217;s and the CMT curriculum. She has also worked to assist me in the Tactical Media project, a project-based learning initiative of the program, in coordinating planning and research, presentations and communications flow for the project. She has also taken the leadership in creating and presenting a number of new media workshops, digital storytelling, for example. Along with her VISTA partner, she coordinated a digital media mini conference for students, faculty and staff.  Danielle has undertaken extensive curriculum research for a study on community media our program is doing in conjunction with the Benton Foundation, as well research for the development of future courses in the College of Public and Community service. Danielle has performed at a very high level of thoughtfulness and strategic insight. Danielle has made an enormous contribution to the CMT program&#8217;s&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>Danielle has quickly become an important part of the Project headquarters team. She has shown admirable persistence in her efforts to draw some useful &#8216;curriculum&#8217; from busy VISTAs and under-utilized &#8216;priority area coordinators.&#8217; I actually think that she has accomplished more in this area than she gives herself credit for&#8211; mostly through her exchanges with VISTAs in the field but also through her (and Shannon&#8217;s) efforts to get VISTAs involved in workshops and events related to the CMT program. She has in some sense become an unofficial VISTA leader through here extensive contact with VISTAs across the country. She has also done a good deal of evangelizing for the Project&#8211; a number of new organizations will be applying as a result of these efforts. She&#8217;s a gifted/natural-born communicator and that&#8217;s just so helpful in so many&nbsp;ways.</p>

                    <p>Jessica has used technology tools to facilitate organizational communication and information gathering/sharing at TCP. These tools included an Intranet, the Vienna newsreader and a del.icio.us account for the organization.  This work has enabled TCP to stay on top of cutting edge issues in the field of youth and&nbsp;technology. </p>
<p>She has also made major contributions in researching, writing, editing and design work for some of our products. This has helped TCP achieve its mission of advocating for digital resources and access to benefit the nation&#8217;s 73 million children and youth, particularly those who are low-income or&nbsp;underserved. </p>
<p>Jessica has also completed several projects for CCTPG, working towards meeting the broader goal of advocating for all communities&#8217; access to broadband and advanced technologies and the benefits they&nbsp;offer. </p>
<p>Working with several colleagues, Jessica helped create the new CCTPG Web site and edited, updated and posted a majority of the documents currently available. She uploaded the contacts currently in the CiviCRM and created an automated sign-up form for new members. She was also responsible for many listserv and Web site updates and helped with several outreach efforts, including a videoconference. She gathered information for an online map of CTCs and helped with CCTPG&#8217;s network&nbsp;restructuring.</p>
<p>One of the measurements of Jessica&#8217;s success was whether CCTPG won any legislative victories while she was serving. Of the four pieces of legislation CCTPG focused on last year, three of them&nbsp;passed.</p>

                    <p>Diana has posted over 1,200 services on 4People.org and has been instrumental in helping the database to grow and advance. She has also designed marketing materials, learned to build computers, trained people on computers, written documents, designed web pages, and done lots of editing. With her help, RECA and 4People are advancing at an amazing&nbsp;pace.</p>
<p>At the six month level Diana has completed a great deal of work towards populating the 4people.org database, which includes youth, seniors and family community services.  She has developed a web page for another non-profit (Catholic Family and Child Services), and taught a class on beginning web page design. By posting services to 4People and continually improving the database, Diana is helping our online database become a viable community resource. We currently have over 4,300 services listed in Eastern Washington, largely thanks to her efforts and the efforts of the VISTA that preceded her. Diana has been instrumental in helping to design the front end interface of 4People to be first time user friendly.  See&nbsp;4people.tcfn.org.</p>

                    <p>Melissa Daigle&#8217;s VISTA assignment began with a focus on support for producing and developing the Community Technology Review, with secondary goals of overseeing initial contact and placement assistance to prospective VISTA applicants, and providing other CTC VISTA Project program support as may follow from these two other objectives and otherwise as needed. Over the course of her first last months, Melissa did very impressive work in all these&nbsp;arenas.</p>

                    <p>Melissa&#8217;s work in serving as Assistant Editor for the Community Technology Review online journal involved overseeing most communication with the authors; manuscript editing and development; online line production and design (a task she&#8217;s undertaken concurrent with learning to use online tools such as Dreamweaver); outreach; subscription management; and general systems and procedures development to insure a more smooth-running operation.  She has laid some useful preliminary foundations for advertising and&nbsp;fundraising</p>
<p>Melissa&#8217;s work in overseeing the project&#8217;s outreach and information pages on the Corporation for National Service&#8217;s information web site and dealing with prospective program VISTAs has been organized and efficient.  Through the late spring and summer, this extreme demands of this task involving communication not only with all VISTA applicants but with project supervisors can be appreciated by the fact that the CTC VISTA Project is the most popular in the entire CNS system.  A combination of work in both these arenas lead to a natural taking on of project-wide development work involving support for Project VISTAs in numerous arenas, the most visible of which were her work in producing a VISTA-focused project newsletter (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter</a>) and overseeing/coordinating the project&#8217;s joint VISTA-Supervisor Advisory Committee.  Along with her contributions to the monthly Boston-area VISTA meetings, serving on the &#8220;First Tuesday&#8221; television production team, filling the gaps and undertaking other initiatives for project support, Melissa&#8217;s leadership is generally recognized by both her peers and the project&nbsp;administration.</p>
