                    <p>Laura’s year with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE) was characterized by a continued maturing of the of the project, both in its partnerships with area schools and its facility with linking MoLLIE efforts to the area mandated curriculum. Relationships that were begun with area teachers in our first two years of operation continued and thrived. Those teachers that utilized MoLLIe in the first year actively promoted the MoLLIE project to their colleagues leading in turn, to an expanded clientele of teachers in a broader selection of&nbsp;schools.</p>
<p>Further relationships developed that Laura was crucial to: In conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice “Project Safe Neighborhoods” (PSN) program, Laura facilitated the efforts of local youths at neighborhood associations and community centers in writing, shooting, performing, and editing their own Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on the subject of gun violence prevention. Another partnership that developed this year in which Laura played a key role was a six month project with Wedgwood Christian Services of West Michigan. Similar to PSN, the Wedgwood project involved providing at-risk teens with the tools, training, and means of transmission to create their own mini documentaries and PSAs focusing on substance abuse prevention. Laura demonstrated a particular facility in getting young women to open up and tell their personal stories in a manner that they might not with male&nbsp;trainer/technicians.</p>
<p>Laura’s final, and perhaps most lasting project, done in conjunction with VISTA volunteer Nate Diedrich, has been the production of an eight-episode instructional module series on the MoLLIE method of video&nbsp;production.</p>
<p>Laura Craig went on to work full-time at Portland Community Media in Portland, Oregon, where she supervised the work of Digital Arts Corps Member Nickey&nbsp;Robare.</p>

                    <p>Susan’s responsibilities required her to split her time between two distinct projects (ScienceQuest and YouthLearn) and she has been wonderful in balancing the work.  Susan has played a major role in enhancing the websites of both YouthLearn and ScienceQuest.  She was responsible for developing new pages and for maintaining the integrity of existing pages.  She played an important role in monitoring the usage statistics of the websites.  Her responsibilities also included assisting ScienceQuest participants through a discussion list, and coordinating ScienceQuest trainings.  Susan has assisted in the creation and production of YouthLearn’s e-newsletter.  She also coordinated a number of special projects for the YouthLearn community, such as assisting applicants to the Beaumont Foundation Technology&nbsp;Grants.</p>

                    <p>The ScienceQuest work plan stayed true to the work Susan did for this project.  She assisted with training, provided ongoing support, and documented progress of ScienceQuest teams.  The original YouthLearn work plan was ambitious in the tasks outlined, and assumed a full-time VISTA would be placed with the project.  Given that Susan has been splitting her time on two projects, tasks on the YouthLearn plan needed prioritizing. Those tasks have been core service enhancement, especially the Website and the electronic newsletter.  She has also been involved in market development, by prospecting organizations and current events in the field of youth and technology, and representing YouthLearn at professional meetings.  As YouthLearn has evolved quite a bit while Susan has been with the organization, other projects have been added to her responsibilities, such as assisting the communities with special initiatives, and researching the creation of printed&nbsp;publications.</p>

                    <p>Without the support of a VISTA member, we simply would not be reaching the numbers of people that we are today, nor with the level of support that we aim for.

After school programs and youth development professionals across the country (and world!) are reaching kids in ways that they might not be able to without these two&nbsp;projects.</p>

                    <p>Heads on Fire partners with social change agencies and community technology companies to provide technology access and education, primarily for youth, in underserved areas. Most of the work takes place after school and in the summer, at sites around the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>Activities are divided into three&nbsp;areas:</p>
<p>The [i]-Team provides digital literacy&nbsp;instruction.</p>
<p>ECHOES magazine helps youth use digital technology to document stories of community interest.<br />
This nationally distributed CD-ROM magazine contains multimedia journalism pieces as well as entertainment sections such as music and game reviews.<br />
Working in close partnership with Christina Glavas, of Minds Wide Open, ECHOES provides training in journalism, digital photography, video editing, audio production, and interactive game design.<br />
Participants work on Saturdays to develop their design skills and take part in a global education curriculum project. Themes such as imagery, oral histories, languages, community orientation, cultural heritage, and other international issues are used as a context for the work.<br />
The work includes traveling to different sites to conduct interviews, as well as production and design time spent in the lab.<br />
The ECHOES training is free and open to youth in San Diego between the ages of 14–18. There is an application process, and participants must be willing to make a ten-month&nbsp;commitment.</p>
<p>The Sunscreens series features the digital work of youth in a two-month gallery exhibit, based on an annual theme.<br />
Each show includes a display of pieces on gallery walls, programs of audio-visual recordings, and interactive kiosks display works created for the computer and the web.<br />
The theme for 2004 was artistic statements made either by or about young Californians who are a part of communities in distress. These included communities affected by crime, poverty, gangs, racism, health crises, refugee status, or social&nbsp;injustice.</p>

                    <p>To thrive in today&#8217;s world, everyone deserves the opportunity to take advantage of the accessibility that technology affords us. Unfortunately, for low-income families and individuals with disabilities, these opportunities and often difficult to come&nbsp;by.</p>
<p>Handy Capable Network (HCN) assists these individuals, as well as local nonprofit organizations, in accessing technology that had previously been beyond their reach. HCN trains adults with disabilities in the skills necessary to use and repair computers. We strive to create an environment where disabled individuals can learn valuable computer skills, gain self-esteem, and encourage personal growth and independence. For low-income families who do not have access to computer technology at home, we provide them with free or low-cost refurbished computers, and the requisite educational information to fully utilize these exciting&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>In order for HandyCapable to carry out its mission of helping socioeconomically challenged or developmentally disabled individuals to cross the digital divide, we depend on donations of used computers from individuals and businesses in the community. To learn how you can help, please click&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>As a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher, HCN installs Microsoft Windows on all of our refurbished computers. Additionally, we format all donated computers to the security standards used by the US Dept. of&nbsp;Defense.</p>

                    <p>Digital Sisters (DS), Inc. is a 501(C)3 non-profit organization created to promote and provide technology education and enrichment for women and children who are traditioanlly&nbsp;underserved.</p>
<p>If the technology field is any indication of messages sent to women and girls research has shown that women have the least penetration in technology fields. This number decreasing by the inclusion of ethnicity and socio economic factors. Young girls are continuously sent daily messages that technology is “not for&nbsp;them.”</p>
<p>Working through enhance partnerships with community based organizations, corporations, technology centers and local schools, Digital Sisters provides assistance in closing the gender gap in technology that is plaguing single mothers. We have developed and implemented programs that promote needed life skills training and address the impact of the lack of technology skills on families. Our educational philosophy is based on a participatory and interactive learning&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>By providing support through in and out of school activities, community outreach and professional workshops, Digital Sisters empowers women and girls which further strengthens&nbsp;families.</p>
<p>Our programs focus on the participants’ current goals; talents, abilities and interests, then begin to explore opportunities in technology. Sessions stress acquiring skills and knowledge that enhance self-confidence. Activities include hands-on experiences in the computer lab, speakers, and field trips. All programs are designed to provide technology education, increase awareness of gender equity, develop skills, to assist in personal growth, enhance learning, and to build&nbsp;self-esteem.</p>
<p>Digital Sisters&#8217; programs and services will help participants to gain knowledge that can help to combat the alienation, apathy, discrimination and non-participation in technology related environments for those who are&nbsp;disadvantaged.</p>
<p>We provide innovative programs to assist traditionally underserved communities in creative, expressive and cooperative methods of learning utilizing technology empowerment strategies. Digital Sisters provides opportunities to families and individuals that might not otherwise get assistance every single&nbsp;day!</p>
<p>In addition we provide program planning and technology curriculum development for local schools, community technology and learning centers utilizing our technology empowerment&nbsp;strategies.</p>
