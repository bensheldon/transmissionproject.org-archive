<p>Due to circumstances outside of Antonio’s control  (staff reduction at San Martin), Antonio had no supervision. It was decided that Antonio would try to work in the computer center at the new MAAC charter school. It turned out to be a good match. We feel that both Antonio and the Charter School have benefited from this new&nbsp;arrangement.</p>

                    <p>David has assisted TSN Coordinator with the procurement, development, distribution and evaluation of instructional materials for member&nbsp;sites.  </p>
<p>David has met with eligible sites independently and jointly with TSN coordinator as well as helped procure and disseminate information between sites and the TSN coordinator.  Because of David’s technical background and ability to grasp the complete picture he has resolved many problems and questions before they could become issues.  Once the financial issues are resolved, David will independently visit the Centers receiving equipment to ensure that its installation is complete and satisfies the Center’s requirements.  As a result of the David’s assistance the current round of hardware and furniture upgrades is ahead of last years&nbsp;pace. </p>
<p>David is serving as the Project Manager for the re-design of the website). Davis is coordinating the translation of a portion of the website into Spanish and is keeping the content of the web site up to date.  David frequently provides help desk support to members using the&nbsp;site. </p>
<p>David is currently serving as a fifth-grade group leader for the Kinetic City program. Kinetic City is a science-based program aligned with Boston Public School standards for grades 3-6 designed to be offered in out-of school time. David along with key staff from member sites will be trained to both run the program and sites as well as on how to train others to lead the program.  David will provide important feedback as we pilot this train-the-trainer program being developed jointly with MIT’s Kavli&nbsp;Institute.  </p>
<p>• David has developed and is maintaining two databases for managing the information needed for reporting to our funders—Boston Connects, Inc. and the Timothy Smith Fund. These databases track information for 40 sites, hundreds of classes, and thousands of&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>• David completed a series of classes at BNN TV’s Multimedia Center and used these new skills to video the recent Girls Get Connected Conference.  It is anticipated that he will turn this into a CD or DVD which can be used for publicity for upcoming conferences.  David will also use these skills to create a CD or DVD of success stories of individuCenter&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>I must take this opportunity to comment on David directly.  He demonstrates a level of maturity far beyond that which I have seen from others in his position.  His attention to detail and in depth-technical skills have has enabled him to successfully create and<br />
maintain the databases critical to the TSN’s daily operation.  David’s work ethic is outstanding—he is never late, he is never absent, he never complains, he is totally reliable.  If I give his something to get done he does it on time and accurately with a minimum of input, much less supervision.  David demonstrates real depth and breadth of perspective in meetings with funders, meeting with TS Center staff, and in meetings with the TSN Steering Committee.  Of particular note is the “business acumen” he applies to the TSN which he acquired through planning his business in&nbsp;Milwaukee.</p>

                    <p>This has been an exciting year for our CTCNet VISTA here at the Durham Literacy Center.  Previous VISTAs have laid the framework for the progress that Brian Russell, this year’s VISTA, has made to date.  Overall, the VISTAs role is to (1) serve as technology integration specialist and oversee learning offerings, including:  PC Basics, ABE, GED, ESOL, Family Literacy and Career Passport; (2) provide web page maintenance and enhancement; and (3) develop technology volunteer&nbsp;plan.</p>

                    <p>The VISTA was responsible for maintaining and upgrading all of our agency’s computers and labs in addition to assisting in making agency-wide decisions as they pertained to technology.  By recruiting and supporting technical volunteers, Brian effectively juggled all of his duties.  Our VISTA provided excellent leadership as the co-chair of our ad-hoc tech committee and guided us through many important decisions regarding infrastructure, training and outreach.  Please see the 04-05 VISTA’s web-blog for details of some of the projects he worked on:  <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/" title="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/">http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/</a>.  However, only a few of his accomplishments are listed on his web log - the rest are highlighted&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.durhamliteracy.org" title="www.durhamliteracy.org">www.durhamliteracy.org</a> Website<br />
The VISTA provided superb research, advice, set-up, development and, ultimately, training to the full staff team on our new website.  After research, the VISTA recommended that we use a program called Civicspace.org, freeware with customizable authoring privileges and a straightforward authoring interface.  The new website has already attracted funders, individual donations, a multitude of volunteers and strengthened interaction with all of our stakeholders.  Each staff member has a blog and the ability to update content.   After the VISTA trained the staff on the basics of the webpage and setting policy, many staff have mastered the basics and have set up more features such as discussion forums for volunteers, calendaring and soon-to-be online&nbsp;forms. </p>
<p>IBM Grant Management<br />
As a beta testing site during this past fiscal year, Durham Literacy Center (DLC) English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) introduced the &#8220;Reading Recognition&#8221; program to approximately 130 students.   While there are still some rough spots in the early version of the application, many students indicated that &#8220;Reading Recognition&#8221; helped them improve their pronunciation, listening and&nbsp;reading.  </p>
<p>The VISTA coordinated volunteers to install 3 new computer labs at DLC and its partner-sites.  Work included installing software and setup on servers and clients, hardware setup.  The VISTA was instrumental in training staff, partners and end users on using the new computer lab and&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>Agency Policy Development<br />
The VISTA effectively researched and gained buy-in by staff and management on best practices for creating policies and procedures appropriate for a non-profit like the Durham Literacy Center.  The VISTA identified sample policies from other non-profits and counseled the management on policies to adopt.  These policies include, but are not limited to the following:<br />
•	Providing donations to partner agencies<br />
•	Laptop loans<br />
•	Use of the computer lab<br />
•	Website content and&nbsp;authoring</p>
<p>The Teen Career Academy<br />
The Teen Career Academy and the Duke Research Service Learning Project – The VISTA created a mobile lab using donated laptops.  The VISTA trained volunteers and teen students on how to use the GED interactive software program and others and tutored teens in the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Adult Literacy<br />
The VISTA participated in our volunteer training on the intensive reading instruction method called the Wilson Method.  From that point, Brian assisted in tutoring some adult literacy students and then led an in-service tutor training activity on the use of technology and in the initial pre-service tutor training&nbsp;session.</p>

                    <p>The Durham Literacy Center is very appreciative of the assistance and contributions that the Digital Arts Service Corps has provided to our partners and us.  Last year, 2004-2005, we were lucky to have a VISTA as knowledgeable and experienced as Brian Russell.  The VISTA took our agency to a new level – our technical infrastructure, integrity and our presentation to the outside world via the webpage are all at the strongest point they have been in&nbsp;years.</p>

                    <p>Goal 1:  Community volunteers have taught the Americorps VISTA Volunteers enough basic computer maintenance and troubleshooting techniques to sustain the computer lab. A Technical Committee of five community volunteers was formed to help troubleshoot technical problems too large or difficult for the VISTA to&nbsp;fix.</p>
<p>Microsoft Access has been used to create databases to track software, hardware, community and technology contacts, and student, tutor, and parent contacts.  Each database has easy-to-use interfaces to update information. Equipment evaluation sheets are cataloged for all incoming and outgoing&nbsp;donations.</p>
<p>A Web Committee was created to re-develop the FOTS website, and contains two volunteer web-professionals.  The new website <a href="http://www.friendsoftylerschool.org" title="http://www.friendsoftylerschool.org">http://www.friendsoftylerschool.org</a> was launched in September 2002.  Easy to use templates were created so that future VISTAS and volunteers can easily update the web content and sustain the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>Goal 2:  Open Lab has fostered a lot of insightful learning due to the one-on-one attention students receive from the VISTA and volunteers.  In addition to Open Lab, three computer courses have been successfully established. Nine students are currently enrolled in other after-school and evening computer classes.  Curricular resources for the computer classes have been identified and cataloged in curriculum binders.  Additional classes and projects are being developed for the spring and summer&nbsp;sessions.</p>
<p>Student files were created to track an initial general assessment to measure computer skills, keyboard efficiency, and technology interests. General program assessments occur&nbsp;quarterly.</p>
<p>Goal 3: The computer center has been operating on a five-day week schedule.  Basic computer literacy skills are being addressed in current computer classes and Open Lab.  Additional classes and projects are being developed by the VISTA in cooperation with community&nbsp;volunteers.</p>
<p>The summer program, Cool Camp, is currently being developed.  Software, websites, and volunteer teachers are being&nbsp;identified.</p>
<p>Goal 4:  A second lab has been established and maintained for tutors to use during tutoring and mentoring.  A software database and computer procedures have been created and posted near computers.  An introductory computer workshop was given to tutors, which covered the Digital Divide Initiative and computer center&nbsp;procedures.</p>
<p>In cooperation with Digital Sisters, seven parents attended a workshop on how to effectively use technology as an educational tool for young girls and teenagers.  Shireen Mitchell, Director of Digital Sisters, presented this&nbsp;workshop.</p>
<p>Goal 5:  Assessment of parents was done over the phone and included getting an idea of technology interests and availability.  Based on initial conversation and meetings, a survey has been completed and will be distributed during future&nbsp;workshops.</p>
<p>Saturday Parent Workshops have been developed for selected weekends through April.  Each workshop is built around a particular topic that can be covered during one&nbsp;workshop.</p>
<p>Goal 6:  Sources have been identified and utilized for receiving equipment donations.  A Verizon grant was awarded for the&nbsp;CTC.</p>
<p>Numerous computer programs, resources, and websites have been identified and catalogued in the computer office for future&nbsp;reference.</p>
<p>Many of the volunteers working with the FOTS Computer Center have been found through <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org" title="www.volunteermatch.org">www.volunteermatch.org</a>.  For example, two volunteers were found for the Technical and Web Committee, and an additional volunteer was recruited as a lab&nbsp;helper.</p>
<p>Digital Sisters, a technology program that promotes technology among women and gender issues, has agreed to help FOTS conduct both parent and youth workshops.  This partnership increases the capacity of FOTS by offering technology training that addresses relevant differences and opportunities between&nbsp;genders.</p>

                    <p>Diana has posted over 1,200 services on 4People.org and has been instrumental in helping the database to grow and advance. She has also designed marketing materials, learned to build computers, trained people on computers, written documents, designed web pages, and done lots of editing. With her help, RECA and 4People are advancing at an amazing&nbsp;pace.</p>
<p>At the six month level Diana has completed a great deal of work towards populating the 4people.org database, which includes youth, seniors and family community services.  She has developed a web page for another non-profit (Catholic Family and Child Services), and taught a class on beginning web page design. By posting services to 4People and continually improving the database, Diana is helping our online database become a viable community resource. We currently have over 4,300 services listed in Eastern Washington, largely thanks to her efforts and the efforts of the VISTA that preceded her. Diana has been instrumental in helping to design the front end interface of 4People to be first time user friendly.  See&nbsp;4people.tcfn.org.</p>

                    <p>From the beginning of her placement Yvette has improved the efficiency and the quality of services delivered to clients of the HPP Technology Center. Yvette has a quiet strength that clients and staff respect and admire. This trait has enabled Yvette to work well with all of the clients of the Technology Center (homeless and formerly homeless families) and with the&nbsp;staff. </p>
<p>Yvette’s work has increased the sustainability of the HPP Technology Center. She has assisted in formalizing HPP’s technology training curriculum for staff and clients. Her work on connecting HPP with educational and vocation al programs in the Bay Area will be enable HPP staff to assist clients in becoming self sufficient. Her excellent work on the resource website for homeless families in San Francisco will enable families and service providers to connect with needed&nbsp;resources. </p>
<p>Yvette managed a team of students from the University of San Francisco to create a resource website for homeless families called <a href="http://www.helping-sf.org">www.helping-sf.org</a>. Yvette met with homeless families, service providers and staff at the Homeless Prenatal Program to ensure the relevance of the site content. She continues to update the site to guarantee that the material is up to date. She has already received praise from staff at San Francisco&#8217;s Department of Human Services and from homeless family service providers. I was recently at a conference were an Executive Director of CTC referenced helping-sf.org as a model to be replicated throughout the Bay&nbsp;Area.</p>

                    <p>HOLA’s AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, Ashley Cross, has been an amazing addition to Heart of Los Angeles Youth (HOLA). You need only visit our new and improved website to see the many ways that she has made a tremendous impact upon the organization.  At <a href="http://www.heartofla.org" title="www.heartofla.org">www.heartofla.org</a> you will see updated stories and press releases which Ashley designed and published.  She also designed and formatted a link for point of donation opportunities, as well as a merchandizing page featuring HOLA cards designed by our youth.  HOLA has received close to $3,000 in donations through our website to date, which funds can be directly attributed to Ashley’s efforts.  We also received a $50,000 grant that came through our new and improved site. Please take a look at the home page and the articles included on the site, which Ashley was responsible for designing and formatting.  Ashley was able to recreate on our web site the entire article about HOLA, including photographs, which was published in “La Opinion”.  She was responsible for creating the Special Events page and many of the stories and pictures throughout the site.  At the same time, we have been able to hard copies of the PDF articles from the web site to form an integral part of HOLA’s press packet.  Ashley’s contribution to the HOLA website is only one very critical part of how she&#8217;s expanded the capacity for our&nbsp;organization.  </p>
<p>Ashley succeeded in refurbishing the 30 laptops ahead of schedule, but the organization encountered some unforeseen obstacles in procuring battery packs, a wireless router, wireless cards, and most importantly, a space to accommodate the Mobile Lab Project.  Thanks to Ashley’s research, these were obtained during the last quarter of her term. While these challenges were being addressed, we added the new goal of increasing the capacity of HOLA’s development office through the overall improvement of the website, which Ashley undertook with great efficiency and&nbsp;success. </p>
<p>The Mobile Lab Project is now slated to be unveiled in March or April of 2006, a successful culmination of Ashley’s research and development efforts.  Batteries, cards and a router have been obtained, and funds have been secured for the build-out of the new Teen&nbsp;Center.</p>

                    <p>Ashley’s ability to accomplish tasks quickly has greatly enhanced HOLA’s public image, giving a much-needed dynamic quality to the website, much to the organization’s benefit.  Because she finished the Mobile Laptop Project in such a timely manner, HOLA was able to gain additional financial support from national companies towards launching a new Teen Center.  Ashley successfully adapted to the new goals as they evolved during the year, and she was able to complete the tasks set out for her before the end of her contract.  Fortunately for Heart of Los Angeles Youth, Ashley’s next post will be as a full-time staff member.  She joined HOLA’s staff as the Bridges After School Manager and Volunteer Coordinator on September 19,&nbsp;2005.</p>

                    <p>Ria has done a good job of connecting with schools and organizations to<br />
create alliances for projects and for recruitment. Ria hasalso  been wonderfully effective at recruiting guest speakers and field trip hosts for&nbsp;GGD.</p>
<p>Ria has done a wonderful job of preparing program information for the public, including the fall GGD update (sent to funders and partner agencies) and the December graduation flier. Because the program’s outreach has been so successful, there has not been a need for the extensive outreach we have had in the&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>I believe Ria’s work on program curriculum and her work in the classroom will be one of her greatest legacies in the program. She has developed strong curricula and has led successful, creative classes. She has developed curriculum for and taught the fall and spring classes and has developed a proposal for a summer video program. Her teaching style with the students has been steadily improving, and her comfort level and ability in working with students in and out of the classroom has been a pleasure to watch&nbsp;grow.</p>
