<p>• Posted rules and calendar of lab hours. Cat has developed a calendar to post for lab hours. She has also met with the volunteer monitors to establish rules for the lab. She is currently working with the monitors to ensure the rules are being&nbsp;followed.</p>

                    <p>Mike Denegal has provided technical assistance to the Family Learning Opportunity Centers (FLOCs) and he’s well respected for his professional technical advice for the organization. The FLOCs began with limited resources, equipment, and program structure. We are glad that Mike has assisted the Community Development Division in growing its resources, researching viable technology funding options, and establishing a line of communication among staff through the message board. Mike displays a high level of enthusiasm for growing the resources and establishing partnerships for SDCTC. He has made sure that both OTS and SDCTC stay abreast on technological trends, resources, policies, and&nbsp;innovations.</p>

Her work in the CTC involved development of curriculum and outcomes for our computer literacy education program and increasing the use of the CTC as an independent learning center.  She also assisted with teaching classes and individual learning&nbsp;projects.  </p>
<p>As a mentor she supported and empowered our staff, all former program participants, through building their computer skills, and supporting their growth in organizational leadership.  Through modeling, working with recruiting and cultivating volunteers, she mobilized and supported student involvement in a variety of&nbsp;activities.</p>

We were able to add a new cultivation event “Lunch on Us” which has resulted in 120 new prospects/donors for our organization.  She also organized and laid a system for grant development accumulating appropriate materials which contributed to the efficiency of grant&nbsp;development. </p>
<p>Amanda increased her Spanish language skills and through our leadership development program began to identify and address her own leadership strength and&nbsp;weaknesses.</p>

                    <p>HOLA’s AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, Ashley Cross, has been an amazing addition to Heart of Los Angeles Youth (HOLA). You need only visit our new and improved website to see the many ways that she has made a tremendous impact upon the organization.  At <a href="http://www.heartofla.org" title="www.heartofla.org">www.heartofla.org</a> you will see updated stories and press releases which Ashley designed and published.  She also designed and formatted a link for point of donation opportunities, as well as a merchandizing page featuring HOLA cards designed by our youth.  HOLA has received close to $3,000 in donations through our website to date, which funds can be directly attributed to Ashley’s efforts.  We also received a $50,000 grant that came through our new and improved site. Please take a look at the home page and the articles included on the site, which Ashley was responsible for designing and formatting.  Ashley was able to recreate on our web site the entire article about HOLA, including photographs, which was published in “La Opinion”.  She was responsible for creating the Special Events page and many of the stories and pictures throughout the site.  At the same time, we have been able to hard copies of the PDF articles from the web site to form an integral part of HOLA’s press packet.  Ashley’s contribution to the HOLA website is only one very critical part of how she&#8217;s expanded the capacity for our&nbsp;organization.  </p>
<p>Ashley succeeded in refurbishing the 30 laptops ahead of schedule, but the organization encountered some unforeseen obstacles in procuring battery packs, a wireless router, wireless cards, and most importantly, a space to accommodate the Mobile Lab Project.  Thanks to Ashley’s research, these were obtained during the last quarter of her term. While these challenges were being addressed, we added the new goal of increasing the capacity of HOLA’s development office through the overall improvement of the website, which Ashley undertook with great efficiency and&nbsp;success. </p>
<p>The Mobile Lab Project is now slated to be unveiled in March or April of 2006, a successful culmination of Ashley’s research and development efforts.  Batteries, cards and a router have been obtained, and funds have been secured for the build-out of the new Teen&nbsp;Center.</p>

                    <p>Ashley’s ability to accomplish tasks quickly has greatly enhanced HOLA’s public image, giving a much-needed dynamic quality to the website, much to the organization’s benefit.  Because she finished the Mobile Laptop Project in such a timely manner, HOLA was able to gain additional financial support from national companies towards launching a new Teen Center.  Ashley successfully adapted to the new goals as they evolved during the year, and she was able to complete the tasks set out for her before the end of her contract.  Fortunately for Heart of Los Angeles Youth, Ashley’s next post will be as a full-time staff member.  She joined HOLA’s staff as the Bridges After School Manager and Volunteer Coordinator on September 19,&nbsp;2005.</p>

This included 3 to 4 hours in the classroom daily, which was extended somewhat, as the class, approached the Semester 1st and 2nd semester finals.  During this period Rob conceived of integrating the in-class instruction with a real world network installation. This was done at the Fenway After-School Program, a program run by the YMCA in a Fenway CDC owned building. The students consulted with the YMCA, reconditioned PC’s, and installed an Ethernet&nbsp;network.</p>

                    <p>Progress has been made in the attendance of children and adults in the CTC&#8217;s maintained for Ed West. At the end of August, we had a 20% increase of children arriving after school to do their homework or just surf on the net since February. We have also made an increase of adult attendance in the courses we held. We have had at least 100 certificates to give to the graduates from our beginner&#8217;s computer courses. Our adults have learned the basics of Microsoft Office and Windows. They have even learned how to search for jobs and build perfect resumes. We have given away at least 50 computers in the last six months to MA Rehab clients and also students that have taken our courses. Donations were made regular by major companies and by individuals who wanted to give to our community. I have also updated all 30 computers with new software that was used by all participants. Especially learning tools for the&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>Part of Paul’s job was the development of a lesson plan to teach residents the basics of computers.  Paul was to create a lesson plan for 6 or 8 week classes that would engage residents with a completion date set, and a new class to begin subsequently.  This did not happen as planned and the one class that has met is still meeting after 12 weeks, with the same four students and no set plan to end.  Paul is not supposed to be teaching directly, but it was allowed assuming that new volunteers were being sought to step in to teach.  With very little success in recruiting and maintaining volunteers Paul chose to teach classes directly, in an effort to get the computer center&nbsp;utilized.</p>

                    <p>James Fishwick&#8217;s VISTA assignment began with a focus on development support for the Greater Boston Broadband Network, support for the growth of the College&#8217;s technology use by faculty and staff and in programs related to the Community Media and Technology program, and CTC VISTA project web site support.  Over the course of his last six months, James continued to do very impressive work in all three areas and concluded his term of service by becoming the project&#8217;s VISTA Leader for a second year of service and attending VISTA Leader training at the end of&nbsp;August.</p>

                    <p>James took on major responsibility for CBC coordination, project web site development, and the monthly pilot cable and web cast &#8220;First Tuesday&#8221; program, undertaking the latter while serving as the Assistant Producer.Overall project coordination involved assisting with monthly meeting arrangements and follow through with subcommittee needs and support.  Web site development included not only design and technical maintenance but content development as well. As Assistant Producer for &#8220;First Tuesday,&#8221; James undertook a wide range of tasks insuring smooth program production, including serving as live-time chat coordinator and on-camera contributor, set design, plant, and web cast coordination, and post-production&nbsp;assistance.</p>
<p>With regard to the College, James continued to provide a good range of support to individual faculty and programs and helped give visible, tangible testimony of the value of the Community Media and Technology program.  In addition to special help to five faculty/programs, James assisted the CPCS IT Task Force, a committee dedicated to a thorough review of the current IT landscape at UMass and its effect on the college. The task force makes recommendations to the college on how to move on various IT issues, especially the establishment and subsequent development of the Clark Taylor Center. James has served as secretary to the committee and has helped to facilitate discussions on needs for the Center with CPCS&nbsp;faculty.</p>
<p>Finally, as the web master for the CTC VISTA Project itself (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista</a>), James initiated a number of design and content contributions that have contributed to the project&#8217;s aesthetic and programmatic presentation for VISTAs, supervisors, and the general public.  His work with the VISTAs in encouraging and helping them develop their own web pages and resources, along with his moderation of the metroBoston and national CTC VISTA member electronic discussion lists and general communication have given him a major leadership status among his fellow VISTAs and in the overall&nbsp;project.</p>
