 <title>Third Coast Conference</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/10/third-coast-conference</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt; Ready to spend two + days with hundreds of fellow producers, artists, students, and audio enthusiasts, talking shop about radio/audio storytelling on the airwaves and beyond? Ready to come together, listen to each other’s work, share ideas and expertise, and make priceless connections with future colleagues and new&amp;nbsp;friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought so. This fall marks our tenth (!) anniversary, and we hope you&amp;#8217;ll celebrate with us over the course of another radio-drenched weekend here in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve lined up some amazing presenters like&amp;#8230;Scott Carrier (Independent), Berit Hedemann (Norway), Amy O’Leary (New York Times), Jamie Tarabay (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;), and Steven Tilley (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AUS&lt;/span&gt;). These and many other radio pros will be tackling a wide range of topics, like&amp;#8230; sound design, voicing, pitching stories, audio slide shows, audio tours, capturing &amp;#8220;the moment&amp;#8221;, equipment and software recommendations, and reporting from unfamiliar places. And that&amp;#8217;s just a&amp;nbsp;taste. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Workshop - “Can News Media Survive the Internet Age? Competition, Consumer Protection, and First Amendment Perspectives.”</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2009/09/workshop-%E2%80%9Ccan-news-media-survive-the-internet-age-competition-consumer-protection-and</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The news industry is in transition. Newspapers have lost much of their classified advertising revenues to online services, and some question how they will weather the development of targeted behavioral and other online advertising, online news aggregators, and other factors. How cable, broadcast, and other news organizations will respond to similar challenges is under discussion. Some predict that in a few years, television and radio will find themselves in situations similar to those facing&amp;nbsp;newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many industries have experienced transitions to new business models in response to new forms of competition on the Internet, and consumers generally have benefitted in the process,” &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FTC&lt;/span&gt; Chairman Jon Leibowitz explained. “But the news business may be different because of the First Amendment values at stake. Whether we get our news from ink on paper, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, radio, laptops, or mobile devices, we need a strong news industry for our democracy to thrive. Bringing together competition, consumer protection, and First Amendment perspectives can help all of us understand how best to serve Americans’ interests given the new realities affecting news&amp;nbsp;organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The CTC VISTA Project has a new name </title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2009/7/the-ctc-vista-project-has-a-new-name</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;BOSTON - The CTC VISTA Project has a new name: The Transmission Project. For 9 years the Project has amplified the use of media and technology within more than 100 non-profit organizations and through 300 members volunteering across the country. While diverse in their missions, the Project&amp;#8217;s partners all have one thing in common: their use of media and technology to challenge social and economic inequality in&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new name, the Transmission Project more strongly emphasizes building capacity for equitable and effective use of public media and technology. To facilitate this, a newly created Digital Arts Service Corps recruits AmeriCorps*VISTA members to further develop our nation&amp;#8217;s public media and technology infrastructure. These full-time volunteers are serving with community radio stations, media arts and technology centers, rural broadband internet initiatives and others seeking to empower their community through the use of media and&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating a Digital Arts Service Corps, the talents and organizing skills of committed volunteers can be harnessed to connect people across online communities and amplify America’s independent media voices and visions. Community-driven teams will design tools, social networks and online environments that bolster and stimulate community-building and participation. They will work with information technology specialists and independent media makers to democratize the next generation of broadband and information&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Digital Arts Service Corps marks a new strategic collaboration with the National Alliance for Media Arts &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Culture (NAMAC). Together, the Transmission Project and NAMAC hope to advance a movement that integrates national service, public digital infrastructure construction, capacity building for nonprofits and innovative uses of the technological arts in public and community-based&amp;nbsp;organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housed at the College of Public and Community Service at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, the Transmission Project and its new initiative, the Digital Arts Service Corps, is a grantee of the Corporation for National and Community&amp;nbsp;Service.&lt;/p&gt;
