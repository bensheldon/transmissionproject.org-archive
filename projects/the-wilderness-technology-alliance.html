Students and volunteers gain work-based learning experiences by providing valuable technology products and services to their school or local community.   Professional skills are gained while marketable products are produced to generate revenues that help sustain the program.  The Alliance typically partners with state education agencies, school districts, community organiziations and other formal or informal teaching institutions, to implement its&nbsp;programs.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>The WTA is establishing a community technology center (CTC) for the homeless as the CCNV shelter.  It provides technology access and training programs for the shelter population, as well as other disadvantaged populations utilizing it.  The VISTA member will train the homeless, then cultivate them to become full-time volunteers at the&nbsp;center. </p>
<p>These trained volunteers will build a self-sustaining service-learning model where trained members of the homeless community gain work-based learning experiences by performing vital technology repair and training services for local non-profit organizations and government agencies.  Small fees will be charged, just enough to self-sustain the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Phase I: Train the VISTA member in WTA service-learning performance tasks (see above).  The VISTA member spends a period of time pacticing these skills by training many members of the homeless community in the CCNV in&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Phase II:  Provide the homeless with professional technology job experience by operating a real high-tech company.   The VISTA member will be trained in the WTA Enterprise Curriculum and will use it to train and support advanced volunteers from the shelter in performing technology service-learning for the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Phase III: Armed with job experience provided in Phase II, service-learning volunteers have a better chance to obtain technology employment or to open their own firms. For a very small group of homeless having the skill set yet lacking the resources and confidence to start their own firms, the WTA and CCNV will provide desk space and the VISTA member will train and support them so they can open their own technology firms in the WTA/CCNV&nbsp;building.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Tony recruited 5 executive board members (all volunteers and all homeless) to lead the governance of WildTech-CCNV. ed the acquisition of all surplus technology for&nbsp;refurbishing. </p>
<p>Tony single-handedly landed a 200 computer donation from AARP, which will be distributed across the&nbsp;region.</p>
<p>Tony rebuilt two technology access labs in the shelter, providing technology access for 1300&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Implemented three sets of 12 week training classes for shelter residents. These included:<br />
1. MS Word<br />
2. MS Excel<br />
3. Introduction to Computers<br />
4. Computer&nbsp;refurbishing</p>
<p>Tony refurbished enough laptop computers to award to every homeless graduate of the 12 week training&nbsp;sessions.</p>
<p>Tony began building an eBay ecommerse training class so homeless can start selling on&nbsp;eBay.</p>
<p>Tony began building a city-wide computer recycling program and assisted in writing a proposal that was submitted to federal GSA and the District of Columbia to have homeless people manage their recyclable&nbsp;electronics.</p>
<p>Managed the writing of 5 grants to five agencies. All writing was done by homeless&nbsp;people.</p>

They have also laid the groundwork for building a self-sustaining service-learning model where trained members of the homeless community gain work-based learning experiences by performing vital technology repair and training services for local non-profit organizations and government agencies. Because of their work, the program has become famous,. The shelter now has quality computers, internet access and many of the 1300 residents are now getting their own computers. This success has been facilitated by the work of Tony and Larry, who have developed marketing and outreach materials, organized events and developed our list of partners and supporting organizations in the community. They have built the capacity of our organization by helping upgrade our constituent database so that we can better track donors and individuals. In regard to our programs, they have helped develop our curriculum and improve our process for refurbishing and distributing computers to program participants at the homeless&nbsp;shelter.</p>

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.
