 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/10/future-of-music-coalition-policy-summit-2010</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Future of Music Policy Summit&amp;nbsp;2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ten years of fighting for musicians, Future of Music Coalition has witnessed tremendous changes in the music ecosystem — from to disruptions in traditional business models to alternative revenue streams for creators. Throughout our history, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FMC&lt;/span&gt; has been guided by the conviction that musicians need access to audiences and adequate compensation to truly&amp;nbsp;thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10th Anniversary Future of Music Policy Summit puts the focus where it belongs: on the artists who are the very reason for our existence. It is the talent and creativity of musicians, songwriters and composers that bring clarity and focus to the pressing issues facing the entire music community.&lt;br /&gt;
Register in July for a discounted rate of $199.  Click here to register&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10th Anniversary Future of Music Policy Summit brings together an incredible array of musicians, arts advocates, policymakers, technologists, media representatives and industry figures to discuss issues at the intersection of music, technology, policy and law. Over three days, connections will be made, challenges will be identified, and solutions will be considered. Your participation in these conversations is crucial to the future of&amp;nbsp;music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us in celebrating 10 years of fighting for musicians as we look towards new&amp;nbsp;horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>FUTURE OF MUSIC COALITION PRESENTS D.C. POLICY DAY 2010</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/05/future-of-music-coalition-presents-dc-policy-day-2010</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;National research, education and advocacy nonprofit Future of Music Coalition is pleased to announce its upcoming &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; Policy Day, which takes place at New America Foundation in Washington, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; on May 4,&amp;nbsp;2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has already seen a host of policy developments that will affect the entire music ecosystem — from network neutrality and the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;’s authority to regulate the internet to international copyright concerns to the impact of health care reform on the music community. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; Policy Day 2010 will bring these issues into focus through informed presentations and panel discussions. A live webcast will bring the conversation to a global audience of artists, academics, industry professionals, journalists, music fans and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics to be covered include the hotly debated Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACTA&lt;/span&gt;), the recent Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger, efforts to preserve an open internet and the health insurance landscape for musicians. Policy Day 2010 will also examine how the creative industries are faring under current Washington leadership as we head into a new election&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Message is in the Music:  Hip Hop Feminism, Riot Grrrl, Latina Music, and More</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/03/the-message-is-in-the-music-hip-hop-feminism-riot-grrrl-latina-music-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Twelfth Annual Women’s History Month Conference&lt;br /&gt;
at Sarah Lawrence College&lt;br /&gt;
Bronxville, New&amp;nbsp;York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Saturday, March 5 &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; 6,&amp;nbsp;2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker: Carmen Ashhurst, former president of Def Jam Recordings and Rush Communications, and author of the forthcoming book, Selling My Brothers: The Movement, The Media and&amp;nbsp;Me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music has long served social movements as a sound track, as a means of communication, and as its own arena for activism. While multiple generations of feminists have used music in these ways, it has played especially vital roles for those born since the 1970s. This conference will explore the ways in which young feminists have defined and expressed politics through music and musical cultures and communities. Among the questions we will ponder are: How does music reflect sites of agreement and conflict among different groups of feminists? How have movements like Riot Grrrl and Hip Hop feminism attracted young women to feminist activism? How do young feminists’ uses of music compare with those of earlier&amp;nbsp;generations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite activists, scholars and artists in all fields to propose papers, panels, workshops, performances, and&amp;nbsp;exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific topics may include, but are not limited&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Hip Hop Feminism&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminism in Latin Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Body Politics in the Music Industry&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminist Messages in World Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Young Feminists’ Musical Icons&lt;br /&gt;
    * Women-owned Record Labels&lt;br /&gt;
    * Zines in Feminist Culture&lt;br /&gt;
    * The Riot Grrrl Movement Lesbian Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * The Politics of Race in Feminist Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Misogyny in Contemporary Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminist Music Festivals&lt;br /&gt;
    * Women in Music Videos&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminist Songwriters&lt;br /&gt;
    * Legacies of Women in Blues, Jazz, Rock, and&amp;nbsp;Folk&lt;/p&gt;
