 <title>Google Announces Launch of Technology Corps</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2011/5/google-announces-launch-of-technology-corps</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Google announced in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/bringing-tech-knowledge-to-nonprofits.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it is launching the HandsOn Tech Corps in collaboration with HandsOn Network, the volunteer arm of Points of Light Institute. Starting this September, the new volunteer corps will develop “technology capacity” that “will help organizations to address mission critical activities more effectively and efficiently.” The Transmission Project congratulates Google on launching an initiative that addresses the demands for capacity building of community-based nonprofits and for the establishment of a national digital literacy corps as laid out in the National Broadband Plan and other policy&amp;nbsp;papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many facets of the HandsOn Tech Corps resemble the Transmission Project’s Digital Arts Service Corps, and Google’s intentions reflect the values of the Transmission Project &amp;#8211; in principle if not in practice. Like the Digital Arts Service Corps, HandsOn places AmeriCorps*VISTA members with nonprofits to complete a yearlong capacity building project. Comparable to the Transmission Projects support network, the new corps provides its paid volunteers with guidance and training beyond what AmeriCorps members would receive working independently in the field. Says Google, the Tech Corps will&amp;nbsp;begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
with a one-week training at our campus in Mountain View, learning about both our nonprofit tools and cloud-based offerings from other technology companies like Salesforce.com and LinkedIn. Once they are armed with tech know-how, they’ll spend the rest of the year in three-person teams serving nonprofits in the Bay Area, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Pittsburgh and&amp;nbsp;Seattle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Tech Corps model, the Transmission Project recognizes its own conviction that technology has a role to play in AmeriCorps*VISTA’s mission of strengthening “nonprofits that are working to lift people out of&amp;nbsp;poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s commitment is certainly a step in the right direction. However, we wish Google and HandsOn would place the particular needs of organizations at the forefront of their new initiative. Google mentions that its Tech Corps members will be trained in its own nonprofit tools. Although familiarity with these tools may prove helpful to some, the solutions its Corps will be able to offer organizations after this kind of training are still highly prescriptive and techno-centric. Nonprofits need and deserve to have a voice in determining the nature of the project that will presumably transform their organizations. For Corps members, much more important than technology skills are the skills to collaborate with organization staff and work toward a solution. For organizations, a technology solution that is well planned-for and has the support of staff is more valuable than a predetermined set of technology practices. Rather than prescribing specific practices, the Transmission Project has served as adviser during the project design process, so that organizations are prepared to maximize the impact that the addition of a Digital Arts Service Corps member&amp;nbsp;makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Google wants to honor its commitment to building the capacity of grassroots nonprofits through technology, it will take into account the work of those already doing so. And it better do so soon. As the Transmission Project departs, it leaves behind a wealth of knowledge and experience. This includes a respect for diverse, grassroots media arts organizations. We invite anyone desiring to take from our ten year history to use the Transmission Project’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://transmissionproject.org/legacy&quot;&gt;legacy&lt;/a&gt; in their&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>In Pursuit of New Literacies</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2011/1/in-pursuit-of-new-literacies</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://transmissionproject.org/sites/transmissionproject.org/files/runningMoney.png&quot; width=&quot;510&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of digital citizenship – equal participation in a democratic society through digital media – and the corresponding need for digital and media literacy in communities have attracted increased attention thanks to reports such as the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s National Broadband Plan. In support of these ideals, this and similar documents call for the launch of a national Digital Literacy Corps and for increased capacity building of community-based organizations that deliver digital literacy&amp;nbsp;education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the work of its Digital Arts Service Corps members, the Transmission Project is answering the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s call by building the capacity of organizations that provide digital literacy education. The media literacy and production programs run by these community-based organizations inspire people of all ages and of different racial, cultural, and economic backgrounds to create media that represent their perspectives while addressing issues important to their communities. Even the young participants of these programs are making a difference to their communities’ media landscapes&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://messagesinmotion.com/&quot;&gt; Messages in Motion&lt;/a&gt; is a project of the Termite &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; collective in Philadelphia that puts the tools and skills of video production into the hands of community members who make short “digital postcards” about issues important to them. The videos participants make are then linked to each other based on common themes. Because participants’ creations are both person- and site-specific, the project contributes to a sense of social topography: people are mutually joined by their interest in common issues facing their communities. Even the very young produce films. Participants’ perspectives are unabashedly personal and biased; they do not speak in the detached language of journalism. But by taking part in a dialogue, even these young people can contribute to a sense of community and the exercise of civic&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Other Half of the&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside recommendations that will expand the work of community-based organizations, the National Broadband Plan supports partnerships between public and private sectors as the most efficient way to deliver quality digital literacy across&amp;nbsp;populations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NTIA&lt;/span&gt; should consider supporting public-private partnerships of hardware manufacturers, software companies, broadband service providers and digital literacy training partners to improve broadband adoption and utilization by working with federal agencies already serving non-adopting communities. Congress should consider providing additional public funds, or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NTIA&lt;/span&gt; should use existing funds to support these&amp;nbsp;partnerships…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These partnerships would support the communities hit hardest by poverty. Participants would be eligible to receive discounted technology products, reduced-priced service offerings, basic digital literacy training and ongoing support. In addition, these partnerships would offer customized training, applications and&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 13th, 2010 heralded one of the first of such partnerships. Common Sense Media announced in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101213005296/en/Common-Sense-Media-Verizon-Announce-Partnership-Promote&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that it would be partnering with Verizon on a digital literacy campaign. The nonprofit will share its “digital literacy and citizenship” curriculum with the telecommunications giant’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkfinity.org/&quot;&gt;Thinkfinity&lt;/a&gt; website, and Verizon’s &lt;a href=&quot; http://parentalcontrolcenter.com/&quot;&gt; parentalcontrolcenter.com &lt;/a&gt; will host weekly Common Sense Media blogs and video&amp;nbsp;tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the effectiveness of community-based media initiatives, why would a non-profit organization that, according to its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, believes in the principles of “free and independent media,” “media sanity, not censorship,” and “a diversity of programming and media ownership” choose to ally itself with Verizon, a company that has instituted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/10/04/verizon.fees.overcharge.fcc/index.html?hpt=T2&quot;&gt;anti-consumer practices&lt;/a&gt;, supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://benton.org/node/40458&quot;&gt;unsound and unreliable net neutrality rules&lt;/a&gt;, and launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://colorlines.com/archives/2010/08/air_has_no_prejudice_but_verizon_does.html&quot;&gt;powerfully misleading ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt;? What can we expect to develop out of this&amp;nbsp;partnership?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Does Common Sense Tell&amp;nbsp;Us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at the curricula that this partnership will promote demonstrates just how divorced Verizon and Common Sense Media’s use of digital literacy concepts is from the actual community work and educational reform that digital literacy and citizenship&amp;nbsp;entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Sense Media’s curricula comprise tools for parents and educators – not kids – to combat the potential hazards of Internet use among children and adolescents and to provide youth with age-appropriate media experiences.  Lessons on how to monitor and control kids’ media experiences and teach them to participate “appropriately” online epitomize the organization’s fearful stance vis-à-vis media. A unit on “Connected Culture” purports to explore “the ethics of participating in and building positive online communities,” but focuses almost exclusively on the threat of cyber bullying.  Pervasive fear characterizes the &lt;a href= &quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/browse/video?type=csm_curriculum_lesson&amp;amp;grade[0]=48259&amp;amp;grade[1]=48260&amp;amp;grade[2]=48261&amp;amp;unit[0]=1823&amp;amp;unit[1]=1835&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that introduces the unit as positive online interactions among teenagers are twisted into instances of harassment with the help of music and editing. Given Common Sense&amp;#8217;s paranoid perspective on media, the positive and negative aspects of online interaction can hardly receive equal&amp;nbsp;treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Sense Media has allowed fear of media misuse to over-determine its understanding of digital literacy. Although questions of online etiquette and safety certainly deserve attention, the nonprofit&amp;#8217;s fear-based stance toward Media results in an approach to digital literacy education that is not only anti-media, but also anti-child. Consequently, the measures it recommends remain prescriptive and precautionary, not reparative or transformative: filter what content your child sees, punish kids for violating the rules you establish, teach them to behave properly online. Despite Common Sense Media’s claim that it upholds digital media as a platform for community involvement, participation in community is reduced to being a polite citizen and literacy is reduced to knowing how to follow codes of&amp;nbsp;conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides adhering to the guidelines the site prescribes, children have little to no role to play in Common Sense&amp;#8217;s vision of online civic life. For instance, the site bemoans the ubiquity of sexual imagery in the media and the insidiousness of advertisements disguised as entertainment targeting youth, but does little to discuss how the media might be changed and what role young people can play in this transformation. According to the organization’s beliefs, restricting children&amp;#8217;s access to media and making better-informed decisions about media consumption can transform the media landscape. When the website does &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/creating-digital-media#&quot;&gt; celebrate kids’ creativity&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot do so without touting the same cautionary reminders. Only if kids follow the rules may their creativity “some day make the world a better&amp;nbsp;place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided Common Sense Media’s protection- and consumer-based methods, its willingness to partner with Verizon seems only logical. Verizon’s Parent Control Center website sells worried parents tools for tracking children’s online behavior. (The Family Locator, Usage Controls, and Security Suite are available to Verizon customers for an additional $4.99 to $9.99/month). The anxious perspective that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSM&lt;/span&gt; conveys can only increase the perceived need for such tools. More importantly, Common Sense Media’s parent-focused, passive approach to media reform aids Verizon’s misappropriation of the concepts of digital literacy and digital citizenship. In practice, these concepts call for teaching kids about the media industry itself, including issues of media ownership, affordability, and other barriers to inclusion in online economies as well as how they can change the structure of the media industry to be more accountable to them. By championing the causes of digital literacy and citizenship without tackling Verizon’s role in maintaining barriers to adoption, the telecomm giant and its public sector partner implicate themselves in a travesty of the concepts. Digital literacy demands more than a 21st century update to the Golden&amp;nbsp;Rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Media as an Answer, not an&amp;nbsp;Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is Common Sense Media’s philosophy a legitimate insistence on age-appropriate lessons for kids who are too young to understand media bias and ownership, or does it signal ignorance of the difficult, multifaceted work that underlies teaching media literacy while underestimating what young people can&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Termite’s Messages in Motion, the curricula taught at organizations hosting Digital Arts Service Corps members stand in stark contrast to the lessons of Common Sense Media. Rather than offering prescriptive advice for parents, their youth programs show respect for people’s different identities and ignite the creativity of young people to share their perspectives. Ashley was a participant in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIM&lt;/span&gt;’s mobile media production studio. Compare her video about her neighborhood with Common Sense Media’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/advice-for-parents/creating-digital-media&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Digital Creation&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; presentation. How can &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSM&lt;/span&gt; claim to promote civic engagement if its proposed solutions only go so far as curtailing kids’ behavior and changing consumer habits? Messages in Motion, on the other hand, forges a connection between creativity and social&amp;nbsp;justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://messagesinmotion.com/2010/12/people-should-stop-doing-drugs/&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://transmissionproject.org/sites/transmissionproject.org/files/Snapshot 2011-01-19 10-46-10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/sacyes&quot;&gt;SacYES&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative of the Center for Multicultural Collaboration, which has locations in Fresno and Sacramento, California. Program participants are graduates of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMC&lt;/span&gt;’s after-school production courses and are paid to make videos, provide technology trainings, and create social media that assists public sector organizations. SacYES and its Fresno counterpart FresYES demonstrate that young people can both create media relevant to social issues and become leaders in their&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Media Literacy Project’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://medialiteracyproject.org/programs/digital-justice-for-us&quot;&gt;Digital Justice for Us&lt;/a&gt; campaign proves that youth can understand media ownership and bias by relating them to their everyday lives. Inner-city youth from Albuquerque record their conversations with peers from rural areas with poor broadband infrastructure. They deploy media to demonstrate how the social ramifications of any medium influence messages conveyed through it. This self-referential use of media is central to any comprehensive notion of digital&amp;nbsp;literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/aEB87RPolHU?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What This Means for Corporate Partnerships and Digital&amp;nbsp;Literacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juxtaposing Common Sense Media’s online lessons with community-based approaches emphasizes the inadequacies of public-private models of digital literacy education. Insofar as digital citizenship connotes the extension of civic life to the digital realm, digital literacy efforts will necessarily include components that address how the same racial, cultural, and economic prejudices that exist offline also impact communication online. Sites like Messages in Motion’s can only serve as forums for community discussion if accessible to all. Digital literacy demands that organizations mobilize their constituencies in pursuit of media justice and universal access to information and communications technologies. The leaders in digital literacy education are doing so through the creative use of digital media itself. Unless Common Sense Media and Verizon can meet the same demands, their lessons are a false promise of digital literacy and&amp;nbsp;citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is the case with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSM&lt;/span&gt;, organizations that claim to promote increased civic engagement across populations through digital media may not recognize what the different needs of communities are, let alone acknowledge that a variety of approaches is required. Based on Verizon’s choice of partners, it seems big companies will ally themselves with organizations whose curricula only reflect the concerns of the company&amp;#8217;s current customers, not the growing diversity of Internet technology adopters. The impotence of this particular partnership to meet the digital literacy needs of communiteis casts doubt on the ability of future partnerships to fulfill the role laid out for them in the National Broadband&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects and initiatives mentioned here only scratch the surface of the youth programming undertaken at current and former Digital Arts Service Corps sites, and many organizations provide youth programming besides digital video production training, such as online journalism and radio.

 <title>FCC Proposes a Digital Literacy Corps</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/3/fcc-proposes-a-digital-literacy-corps</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At today&amp;#8217;s Digital Inclusion Summit, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; Commissioner Mignon Clyburn introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-296738A1.pdf&quot;&gt;National Digital Literacy Corps&lt;/a&gt; as a recommendation within the to-be-announced National Broadband&amp;nbsp;Plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The central feature in this program, the proposed National Digital Literacy Corps, is similar to programs like AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps. The Digital Literacy Corps will mobilize hundreds of digital ambassadors in local communities across the country.  This is about neighbors helping neighbors get online.  The Corps can target vulnerable communities with below-average adoption rates like low-income housing developments, rural towns, Tribal lands, and areas populated primarily by racial and ethnic&amp;nbsp;minorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country has long recognized the power of education and information, particularly for those who face other disadvantages.  Frederick Douglass once said, “Once you learn to read, you will forever be free.”  Nothing can open more doors for a person than literacy.  But knowing how to read is no longer sufficient to be “literate” in the 21st Century.  Basic literacy must be supplemented with digital&amp;nbsp;literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission already has experience in a related program that gives us confidence in its ability to succeed.  During the waning months of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DTV&lt;/span&gt; transition, the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; enlisted the help of AmeriCorps to go out into communities across the country to help consumers hook up their converter boxes in order to ensure that they would continue to receive free, over-the-air television following the transition.  Young men and women fanned out across the country – from right here in Washington, D.C., to New Orleans, Denver, and Los Angeles.  They were welcomed into people’s homes, and helped them get ready for the transition and&amp;nbsp;beyond.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same spirit can be applied to the longer-term goal of helping our nation’s citizens gain the necessary digital literacy skills to participate fully in all that broadband has to offer.  Using people from within the community to help their neighbors can go a long way to ensuring that people are able to use the Internet safely, and to its fullest&amp;nbsp;potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some non-adopters, particularly older Americans and those who are not touched by technology in their communities, may be uncomfortable operating a computer or might be worried that being online exposes them to excessive dangers.  Helping those people understand basics about computers and the Internet may be enough to get them&amp;nbsp;online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study commissioned by the Social Science Research Council highlighted the role of communities in supporting digital literacy.  Non-adopters and new users, especially those in low income and minority communities, often rely on the assistance of others to get online or provide one-on-one support.  This fact is also why we recognize the need for continuing investment in public access points like libraries and community based&amp;nbsp;organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  We have talented young people graduating college committed to doing volunteer work in their communities, who may be unable to find jobs right away.  And we have workers laid-off mid-career searching for employment opportunities that require a new set of skills.  The Corps can put these people to work building our nation’s digital skills and building upon its history of grassroots action and community service.  Then our country and all of our people will be prepared to compete in the 21st Century global economy.  It can help ensure that the online community is an inclusive&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle of inclusion is part of the foundation of our democracy.  It is embedded in the statute that created the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;.  And it must be at the heart of the National Broadband&amp;nbsp;Plan.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we can work to ensure that the rich promise of our technological future reaches all Americans, and that all Americans can take advantage of all that broadband has to offer.  This is our aim, and this is our&amp;nbsp;responsibility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at the Transmission Project, we can&amp;#8217;t help but notice the marked similarity this has to &lt;a href=&amp;#8221;http://report.knightcomm.org/recommendation-12&amp;#8217;&gt;Recommendation #12&lt;/a&gt; of the Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities. Commissioner Clyburn&amp;#8217;s remarks do integrate our criticisms of that recommendation&amp;#8212;that &lt;a href=&amp;#8221;http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/3/youth-have-a-role-but-so-do-others&amp;#8217;&gt;the Corps itself must model the inclusion it serves to create&lt;/a&gt;. This plan focuses both on young adults as well as&amp;nbsp;mid-careerists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No plans yet recognize the potential for creating a corps of retirees to serve as digital liaisons to their peers, or to harness retiree&amp;#8217;s (and others&amp;#8217;) experience in building the organizational capacity of public media and technology organizations who have been on the front-lines of technology adoption for quite some&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
