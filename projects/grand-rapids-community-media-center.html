      <div class="field-label">Project Description:&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="field-items">
            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>Our newest project, for which a vista would help us build a sustainable structure, has received initial funding via the The Grand Rapids Community Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The purpose is to establish four Neighborhood News Bureaus (NNB) in the city. The purpose is to increase citizen engagement and to encourage greater flow of meaningful information from and to our urban neighborhoods. The NNB project will give Grand Rapids citizens the opportunity to become citizen reporters with a soon-to-be established online and physical network of neighborhood news bureaus in the urban core. The CMC will give citizen reporters the tools, structure and mediums by which to gather, write and report on local news and events. Reporters will be able to produce news for the web, radio or TV through the use of CMC’s resources. NNBs will be physically located in known neighborhood gathering locations, and each site will be outfitted with video and still cameras, computers, audio recorders and templates plus the connectivity required to “file” stories to the web. Additional production equipment and facilities are available for citizen reporter use through the Community Media&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>How you determined the need for this project:<br />
The traditional methods of reporting local news are facing more and more challenges. We’ve seen our local daily newspaper go from four sections to two during the week and it is now consolidating with the papers in Kalamazoo and Muskegon. The Detroit Free Press will have home delivery only 3 days per week. The local network news is laying off staff and airing an ever increasing number of pre-packaged fill stories that have nothing to do with Grand Rapids, MI. This project will bring more media and technology services to our urban neighborhoods and help to increase the flow of local information from a local perspective to our&nbsp;citizens.</p>
<p>Why this project is timely:<br />
Across the entire country, funding for local cable access television is at risk and the addition of neighborhood news bureaus will bring the CMC into a completely new area of communications expanding our capacity to serve the city of Grand Rapids in a whole new way. The CMC has been involved in ensuring that citizens have a voice for 25 years with the NNBs we are expanding that reach at a time where citizen journalism is coming into its own in progressive communities. There are more than 800 active citizen journalism outlets in the U.S. and the list is growing. Our project partner, the Grand Rapids Community Foundation, considers an increase in the flow of local news and information to be a core community need in pursuit of increased Civic Engagement; a key objective of the&nbsp;foundation.</p>
<p>• How the project would increase community engagement:<br />
Since recently announcing the project, we have received literally hundreds of calls expressing interest in being part of the project. Currently many neighborhoods do not have the resources, training or skills needed to produce news stories about their neighborhoods. Often they are frustrated by the way traditional media outlets portray what is happening there. They have a strong desire to be able to tell these stories from their perspective. Each bureau will be initially staffed with a news team comprised citizens and college journalism/communication students who live and/or work in the neighborhood. As the projects grow, each will be encouraged to develop its own leadership/advisory&nbsp;board.</p>
<p>• How the project relates to other activities or elements of your organization or community:<br />
Our mission statement is “Building Community Through Media” The word “Community” is defined as: a social group of any size whose members reside in a specific locality, share government, and often have a common cultural and historical heritage. It is our mission to help build stronger communities by bridging the digital divide, and by helping people and communities share their stories with others using CMC services and&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>The addition of a CTC VISTA member would provide a much needed staff person to help design and establish sustainable structures for the NNB project. While a Knight grant was indeed awarded to this project, all grants in this cycle were reduced by 40% due to the current economic climate. The VISTA member would help use move forward, as planned and would be a main support person for development of the local NNB locations. The work would include neighborhood outreach, collecting and organizing training materials, doing initial set up and organization of NNB&#8217;s and creating materials for use in story management and distribution for later use by editors and news&nbsp;gatherers.</p>
<p>Each bureau will be initially “staffed” with a news team comprised of neighborhood residents and college journalism/communication students. As the projects grow, each will be encouraged to develop its own leadership/advisory board. The VISTA member will help ensure high quality and fairness in the program by establishing a pool of professionals to provide training to&nbsp;participants.</p>
<p>Additionally, VISTA will help establish a structure and methods for collecting and maintaining a neighborhood information &#8220;bank&#8221; for use by the news&nbsp;bureaus.</p>

                    As a demonstration project for citizen journalism and increased citizen engagement through media and technology, it is expected that models and practices developed will provide leadership and tools for other communities. Indeed, the Knight Foundation funds come with an expectation the we act as mentors to future community growth projects that employ new media. The web based infrastructure will be open source based and sustainability lessons will be available to others. Locally, stories produced through the New Bureau projects will be broadcast on our noncommercial television and radio stations and made available to local network stations.        </div>

<p>Primarily, the Vista will be working on the establishment of the physical neighborhood news bureaus. They will be responsible for helping set up the physical and technical structure and coordinating with an initial corps of trainers to provide training for the&nbsp;neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Vista will work with our core NNB steering group and committees to carry out the the project development plan. Work will include relationship building with potential host sites, arranging for assistance for chosen sites; working with the journalists committee to identify training needs and develop a curriculum and recruit presenters; working with the PR committee to prepare our news bureau community launch activities: utilize social media frameworks to increase interest and connect with potential partners; develop user feedback mechanisms; and will produce user guidelines and other reference pieces to aid in community access and use of the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>Goal 1: To help the CMC fulfill its mission of “Building Community Through Media” through the development of a Neighborhood News Bureaus.<br />
Goal 2:  To help the CMC be an ever more active presence in the Grand Rapids area as a vital resource for free speech and information about what’s happening from the citizen’s point of&nbsp;view.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>The primary goal was for Denise to help &#8220;design and establish sustainable structures for the&#8221; Neighborhood News Bureau project&#8230;now called the Rapidian. Denise has done an outstanding job at reaching out to the community to gather input, creatively think through the citizen reporting process and create procedures, structures and partnerships that support those processes. She has organized training materials and events; evaluated and revised methods, and researched other &#8220;best practices&#8221; bringing those lessons to bear on The Rapdiian project. Denise worked effectively in a team that included a drupal developer, a content coordinator (part time), the design manager and the publisher. As the only person dedicated FULLTIME to the launch and evolution of the project, Denise has taken an inspiring leadership role, allowing us to reach farther into the community and engage new&nbsp;participants.</p>
<p>We have expanded our reach and perceptions of relevance in the community (for the good). Mainstream/traditional media now includes us in discussions; promotes our work and even seeks our input and advice as they look to expand their use of community reporters. We a re currently working on the development of a business model to sustain the work, however, our &#8220;user engagement numbers&#8221; are&nbsp;significant.</p>
<p>The project was sufficiently open ended enough to allow Denise great creativity to design execution plans. But in addition to The Rapidian proper, she has extended a connection to our community radio station and represents the Rapidian weekly on-air. She has also established a drupal working group in our&nbsp;community.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Over the course of Sarah&#8217;s Vistaship she has been instrumental in working with our various youth training programs providing a wide variety of skills. She was responsible for helping students make the best videos possible and teaching them to think critically about media and media messages. She took the initiative to outreach to communities we hadn&#8217;t worked with in the past including GLBT and the Triangle Foundation, and solidified relationships with them and our organization. She helped plan a film festival and worked on several video installations dealing with issues such as the war and discrimination. In addition, Sarah has helped out in our theater by operating the lighting board for concerts, selling tickets and running concessions. She teaches video production and editing classes to our members and so much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Here is a list of projects Sarah was involved in during her VISTA&nbsp;year:</p>
<p>1.Allegan County Community Mental Health: produced, shot and edited a documentary about the stigma of mental&nbsp;illness.</p>
<p>2. G.E.T. Girls Empowering Together: since January worked with a group of High School girls in a leadership mentoring program to mentor, produce, shot and edit a documentary about the program, “Breaking the Surface,” available for viewing at <a href="http://www.archive.org" title="www.archive.org">www.archive.org</a></p>
<p>3. The MOLLIE Club: a weekly video club for students in middle School that provides an opportunity for them to come in and Make&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>4. MOLLIE (Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education): Went to area schools and non-profits teaching youth how to produce, shoot and edit&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>5. Real Pride: helped start the planning process for a film and documentary series about LGBT&nbsp;issues.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Richard was a crucial part of the Mollie youth video team, providing youth access and exposure to digital video technology during Mollie moviemaking video projects with schools and community groups. Richard was especially instrumental in the use of digital audio technology, integrating audio technology into the Mollie youth projects and other GRCMC&nbsp;departments.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Richard assisted the education department with youth outreach curriculum development efforts, developing innovative ways to expose community youth to digital audio and video technology. He developed interest surveys for school and community info. gathering and assisted with the implementation of an open house for CMC Wealthy neighborhood residents. Richard was a member of the SMART Festival planning team, an international student media arts festival organized and hosted by&nbsp;GRCMC..</p>
<p>A particular story that stands out is the use of audio resources and curriculum developed by Richard: There was a young man named Patrick who was 14 years of age and lived across the street from Media Center with his Mom and 6 brothers and sisters. He would drop by the media center often after school. He learned a variety of video production skills and produced a few short studio productions for air on community television, but nothing seemed to really stick with him.  One day we asked him to produce and record a rap that could be used for promotion of the Mollie youth program. You could see the excitement in his eyes at that suggestion. In a matter of weeks he had the rap written out and beats to use with it created on the computer.  Using the tools and resources Richard had collected and organized, we were able to both find a passion for this young man and help promote our programs and&nbsp;organization.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Abby’s year with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE) was characterized by a  transition of the project  from a previous role of working in traditional classrooms to a new service area involving after-school programming for at risk children. Over half of the jobs MoLLIE took in the 2004-05 school year were at after school centers run by the School district in conjunction with the city Parks and Recreation&nbsp;Department.</p>
<p>MoLLIE taught participating children how to write, shoot, and edit, for cablecast, their own curriculum-linked skits, PSAs, and mini documentaries.  As a MoLLIE trainer/technician, Abby was essential to the success of those&nbsp;programs.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Other ongoing projects that Abby was crucial to the success of&nbsp;included:</p>
<p>- “Project Safe Neighborhoods” (U.S. Department of Justice) in which Abby facilitated the efforts of local youths at neighborhood associations and community centers in writing, shooting, performing, and editing their own Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on the subject of gun violence&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>-  Wedgwood Christian Services of West Michigan.  Similar to PSN, the Wedgwood project involved providing at-risk teens with the tools, training, and  means of transmission to create their own mini documentaries and PSAs focusing on substance abuse&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>Both of these long term projects have been very successful due in large part to Abby’s commitment, diligence, professionalism, expertise, and willingness to work with at risk&nbsp;teens.</p>
<p>Abby’s final, and perhaps most lasting project, done in conjunction with previous VISTA/Americorps volunteers Laura Craig-Bennett, Amy McKenzie, and Jennifer Harris, has been the editing of a four-episode series of documentaries entitled “Girls to Governors” which commemorates the role of  Michigan women in politics.  Funded locally by the Nokomis foundation of Grand Rapids, the VISTA/Americorps producers of “Girls to Governors” seized upon the election in 2001 of Michigan&#8217;s first female governor, to examine the emerging role of women in local, state, and national politics and public&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>The editing of this series was the capstone event in and outstanding year of service provided by VISTA volunteer Abby Balazs.  The VISTA program should be very proud to have Abby as an alumnae just as we are proud to have had her as an employee and team&nbsp;mate.</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>In building the capacity of the Grand Rapids Institute for Information Democracy, Tom took on the following&nbsp;responsibilities:</p>
<p>Media Monitoring – this includes daily logging of local news coverage for the studies that GRIID produces yearly on election coverage, race <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gender representation, and any other issue that we may be monitoring. This may also include occasional monitoring of entertainment media; commercials, movies, ads,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Grant Funded Projects – this includes assisting GRIID on grant funded projects that involve working with students and community groups on issues such as tobacco, gender issues and the West Michigan Progressive Directory. This work gives us an opportunity to apply the resources developed in the media monitoring&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Web Site Maintenance and Design – Tom has learned some of the basics of web design and has helped update and create new content for the GRIID website (<a href="http://www.griid.org" title="www.griid.org">www.griid.org</a>).  In particular, he updated the GRIID media directory and the GRIID lending library pages.  Tom also designed and created his AmeriCorps VISTA web page (<a href="http://www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/" title="www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/">www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/</a>).   </p>
<p>Community Outreach Projects – working on various community-based projects that GRIID is involved in through the Progressive Directory. This involves attending meetings, conducting media trainings, producing media with community groups, and promoting the coalition building through the Progressive Directory. In many ways this is the main outcome goal of GRIID – getting community groups to develop their own media&nbsp;strategies.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Tom played an essential role in completing the Youth Anti-Tobacco Advocacy  Project (<a href="http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/" title="http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/">http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/</a>)  He collected and correlated all the data for this study and created the online report.  He also worked with the student volunteers in creating the study and accompanied them when they presented the study to the Grand Rapids City commission.  Tom also helped in the creation of several grant-funded video productions that GRIID produced, assisting in both the editing and the filming&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Tom does about half of the actual news watching that GRIID undertakes, and is responsible for documenting and tabulating all of the news watching data collected.  He also has taken an active part in writing GRIID studies examining local media coverage on various issues. Over the last six months, Tom played a significant role in creating the content in GRIID’s Election Watch 2004&nbsp;feature.</p>
<p>Tom worked on the grant funded Video Voter Project.  This project tied into GRIID’s election monitoring and education efforts.  Tom’s work monitoring and documenting news coverage were important components of the Video Voter&nbsp;Project.</p>
<p>Tom has been involved in several projects designed to reach out and empower community groups. Tom has been one of the producers of Catalyst Radio, a weekly radio program on the CMC’s radio station WYCE FM.  Catalyst Radio provides news analysis and interviews featuring local community groups and organizations.  Tom writes half of the news analysis pieces as well as being one of the shows on-air voices.  He also is responsible for setting up and conducting the interviews on occasion as well as updating the Catalyst Radio website every&nbsp;week. </p>
<p>Another community outreach effort that Tom has been involved with is GRIID’s work on FCC license renewals procedure education.  This is an effort to build an awareness in the community on the FCC license renewal process which was designed to hold the local TV media accountable to community needs.  As part of this project, Tom has given presentations, created mailing literature, and helped create online&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>GRIID maintains a large collection of documentaries pertaining to issues of media literacy and media and democracy.  Tom has helped organize and promote public showings of these documentary films.  Tom also helped facilitate public discussions following the&nbsp;films.</p>

Amy did a superb job of handling the logistics of the move as well as developing and implementing new organizational procedures for all aspects of the operation, including staff, equipment, and&nbsp;scheduling.</p>
<p>Additionally, Amy has taken charge of making sure that the work on each project in completed, compiled, put to tape, and aired on GRTV as part of “MOLLIE Matinee” which airs every Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. In many ways, the most important part of the video process (including script, story board, shooting, and editing) is watching the final product air on TV, and Amy makes sure that this part happens each&nbsp;week. </p>
<p>Finally, though it hasn’t been mentioned the biggest part of Amy’s work (as it is with every member of our team) is going to the schools and after-school centers and working directly with the students. Amy has a gift for working with students, and a strong background in video production that results in both high-quality student videos and high-impact&nbsp;learning.</p>

<p>As a long time supervisor and department head, I have seldom had a team member that consistently performs at the high levels of excellence as does Amy McKenzie. The VISTA program should be very proud to have her as an&nbsp;alumna.</p>

Working with the CMC video artist in residence, Jason produced a promotional video that will help insure the future of this fledgling project that is only funded for a year. In addition, he extended GRTV outreach efforts by providing much needed video help to local non-profits who otherwise could not afford&nbsp;it.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Jason became a key participant in making our Spring Alliance for Community Media conference a success. With his local connections with artists, Jason put on an art installation that included a live broadcast on Channel 24 Livewire, interactive wireless video transmission, and addressed contemporary issues with technology and community&nbsp;development/education. </p>
<p>His most recent contribution to the future of this organization, relates to his new job description. As Public information officer, Jason is using his graphic design skills to create a new&#8221;image and look&#8221; for the CMC. Now we have someone doing regular press releases, sending out event information to local calendars, and supporting the CMC outreach efforts. The CMC looks forward to Jason&#8217;s second year of&nbsp;service.</p>

Now fully operating under the umbrella of the CMC as my special staff person, Jason has worked on coordinating many of our Public Relations and Marketing efforts.  He has been instrumental in establishing a presentation standard for CMC tours, which are happening more regularly under his watch.

                <span class="field-content"><p>Jason has been instrumental in coordinating the special events that CMC has sponsored or hosted.  He has willingly shouldered the duty of making appearances at public functions as the CMC representative, recently meeting the esteemed Governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm, the morning after her State of the State&nbsp;Address.  </p>
<p>Other special events include the nationally recognized educational broadcast of the JASON XIV Project. This weeklong workshop was at held at local gathering place Celebration Cinema where Jason led the CMC’s presence, reaching out to the youth of our community.  This high-profile event that was attended by many of Kent County’s eight graders and was broadcast 24/7 on GRTV’s second channel&nbsp;LiveWire.  </p>
<p>Most recently, Jason coordinated a visit from Detective Sullivan (Oprah Winfrey, the Today Show, and others have featured his new book and software), who teaches Cyber-Safety to school children and their parents.  In addition to his interview during drive-time on WYCE 88.1FM, our sponsorship of his visit has resulted in exposure in the Grand Rapids Family&nbsp;Magazine.</p>
<p>Jason has helped the CMC become the production house for the statewide broadband mapping initiative “LinkMichigan.”  He designed the LinkMichigan brochure and has recently taken over the large task of redesigning the “FREE Internet Access” brochure that includes a map, location, and hours for every public Internet Access site in Barry, Ionia, and Kent Counties.  When finished, this brochure will be featured as part of a large marketing campaign funded by the state to promote already existing Internet Access sites and Community Technology Centers in the&nbsp;area.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Daniell&#8217;s entire term was devoted to the creation, expansion, and future sustainment of the MOLLIE Project.  MOLLIE (which stands for Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education) was developed through a grant from the Federal Department of Education and exists to bridge the digital divide, primarily by teaching video production in schools, drop-in centers, and neighborhood&nbsp;centers.</p>
<p>He was given the primary responsibility of getting the program off the ground, including designing the logo, acquiring the equipment, creating the protocols, giving presentations, and implementing the program in the field.  These were his foremost foci for the first six months of his term.  The second half of his term centered on keeping the project&nbsp;afloat.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>The number of schools and non profit organizations that MOLLIE was serving rose significantly throughout the early Spring, necessitating an exponential staff expansion. Though this increased the number of hours Daniell spent directly teaching video production at schools and community organizations, it also allowed him to focus his time back at the office on the following issues:<br />
- the temporary and permanent storage of digital video,<br />
- the development of a long-distance, high-speed, fixed-point, wireless network, and most importantly,<br />
- the future sustainability of the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>At the completion of his term, Daniell was hired full-term by the Media Center as the MOLLIE Technology&nbsp;Coordinator.</p>
<p>As part of the sustainability plan for the project, Daniell has recruited an Americorps VISTA volunteer (Amy McKenzie) that has filled the position he left vacant when he became full-time staff at the end of his term.  He is currently serving as Amy&#8217;s direct&nbsp;supervisor.</p>

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
