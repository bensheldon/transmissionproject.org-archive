        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Sue has helped us launch our project nationally, and we know have over 350 affordable and public housing facilities using “Abilities for Resident Service Coordinators” to link low income frail elderly and disabled residents to community services.  “Abilities for Resident Service Coordinators” has been endorsed by the American Association of Service Coordinators and is acknowledged by industry professionals as a vital tool in keeping elderly residents in independent living.  With the infusion of technology in elderly and disabled resident service coordination, properties are able to keep residents independent, and avoid unnecessary and costly institutionalization.  This project is a prime example of using community technology to meet pressing needs, and impact important policy&nbsp;areas. </p>
<p>Sue helped us attend a national conference in San Antonio, Texas, in which we brought 20 laptops and set up a training lab.  We taught Resident Service Coordinators how to use technology to link their residents to community services, manage their residmonitor resident and program outcomes with&nbsp;technology. </p>
<p>Sue has been a vital player in helping us develop an implementation plan for CTCs in affordable housing communities in Southern California, as she is at our office early every day to assist with implementation.  Her involvement helped us determine that we could expand beyond 50 to now over 200&nbsp;CTCs. </p>
<p>Sue led the effort at Pangea Foundation to develop the training manual for our users.  She has helped develop the 100+ page training manual that is available to users when they log into the system.  This is an ongoing effort.  She also helps with phone training, and attended our training conference in San Antonio,&nbsp;Texas.</p>
<p>Sue has helped run the show at Pangea with the Resident Service Coordinators.  She is the first to receive their calls when they need technical help.  She continuously tests the systems.  She helped create the training manuals and system forms for printed materials.  Sue’s involvement as an AmeriCorp*VISTA member enables our organization to provide these services to the community. To date, this system has over 200 properties using it, which represents service delivered and managed to 20,000 low income elderly and disabled residents across the&nbsp;country.</p>

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
