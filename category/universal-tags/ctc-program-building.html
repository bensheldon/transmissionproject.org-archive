                    <p>The Americorps VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and piloting a technology class for our English speaking clients, the majority of whom are African-American. The goal is to motivate women from the HPP&#8217;s English speaking support groups to avail themselves of the resources in the computer lab.  To reinforce and extend the class experience, the Americorps*VISTA will create a weblog specifically for these clients where they can share their interests, issues, questions and accomplishments. The weblog community will serve as an additional support group to these parents as they seek ways out of poverty. Through participation in classes, one-on-one instruction, and the weblog, these clients will upgrade their job and communication&nbsp;skills.</p>
<p>Our 2004-2005 VISTA developed a community web-site for homeless families and families in jeopardy of becoming homeless.  This website is fast becoming a vital resource to such families and to case managers throughout the region for instant access to resource information.    This years Americorps VISTA would expand the use of the website by (1) developing a workshop to introduce the website to new users, both clients and case managers,  (2) develop promotional materials such as email announcements and posters, and (3) work with other volunteers to develop a separate homepage, navigation system and additional features just for case&nbsp;managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and coordinating a staff development program in the CTC. Since one of the best practices for strengthening a program such as ours is to invest in our case workers, we are planning to use the CTC for more staff development than in previous years.  We will develop an on-line assessment tool to establish a baseline of the technology skills of all staff members. Using this data we will develop and coordinate skill set workshops tailored to staff needs that will be held in the&nbsp;CTC.  </p>
<p>To strengthen and  expand our job readiness program the Americorps*VISTA will be responsible for developing 5  In order to do this the VISTA will identify, contact and visit appropriate educational and vocational training programs.  In addition the VISTA will develop referral protocols between these programs and HPP Case&nbsp;Managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer will also coordinate our &#8220;Computers in the Home&#8221; Project. This project takes our capacity to give technological skills and experience to the underserved population beyond the walls of our CTC. Funded to provide 40 families with refurbished computers and in-home tech support through ReliaTech, a social venture project of StreetTech of Richmond, CA., participants receive training and, upon completion of the training, computers and periodic in-home tech support. In addition, clients who have received computers for their homes continue to receive training at the HPP&#8217;s&nbsp;CTC. </p>
<p>Finally, the Americorps*VISTA will collaborate with our partners in the Community Connectivity Collaboration (One Economy, StreetTech, ReliaTech, Canal Alliance, TechFutures), a group formed to define needs of local CTC&#8217;s and find ways to seek funding. The VISTA will attend CCC meetings and other partnering events that may&nbsp;develop.</p>

                    <p>I know that I speak for the entire staff of the Homeless Prenatal Program (HPP) when I say that Ellen-Rae Cachola has been a boon to our organization. As her supervisor in the Community Technology Center it has been my pleasure to work very closely with her for the last 12 months. She is highly committed, intelligent, and industrious. She is extremely productive and always looking for new projects. She is also very personable, able to interact warmly with the diverse groups of people who work in our program and who come here for services. We are very lucky that she has stayed on at HPP as a part-time employee while she attends graduate school in San&nbsp;Francisco.  </p>
<p>Ellen&#8217;s duties at HPP have included maintaining two websites, teaching technology in English and in Spanish, maintaining and developing the client database on Microsft Access, as well as trouble shooting technology problems in the lab and at staff workstations. She has worked with the local cable television access station to create PSAs and informational programming. In addition she has created an online generator for our paper forms which allows staff to print forms on an as needed basis from their own computers. She has also designed and published agency literature and signage in english and in&nbsp;spanish.</p>

                    <p>The AmeriCorps*Vista will lead a commissioned survey of 150 CTCs in San Diego and take an active role in the centralization of the SDCTC as the regional organization for community technology in San Diego. The AmeriCorps*Vista also will revise and expand current bi-quarterly evaluation methods. The AmeriCorps*Vista will use the CTC survey data results to develop more opportunities for programming and resources sharing among San Diego area CTCs. The AmeriCorps*Vista&#8217;s crucial role will also be that of helping to faciliate more workshops and trainings focused on curriculum and resource sharing in collaboration with organizations and agencies involoved with community technology. The outcome will produce tranings and events that network San Diego area community technology centers, thus allowing more program development directed towards CTC staff and&nbsp;end-users.</p>

<p>As part of her workplan, Ms. Baker completed three self-paced tutorials on our most popular subjects in word processing, spreadsheets, and the Internet. She has also created her own column in our quarterly newsletter called “Tech Corner”, and has completed 5 articles on the most common issues that computer users&nbsp;encounter.</p>
<p>Ms. Baker has established a system of tracking and record-keeping that are important to program evaluation. For example, Ms. Baker has created an attendance log for each course offered by our community technology center, a system of generating class certificates from our database, and new course registration forms that with help make our record-keeping more&nbsp;efficient.</p>
<p>Ms. Baker has also created a popular new program entitled “Afternoons with Angie”, which allows participants with certain questions or issues about their computers or other technology to receive personalized, one-on-one&nbsp;attention.</p>
<p>As a result of our AmeriCorps*VISTA’s contribution to our program and community, we have brought Ms. Baker on board as an official part-time staff person to continue her work at our technology center. We recognize the value that Ms. Baker has put into her service as a VISTA, and look forward to her continued&nbsp;contributions.</p>

                    <p>Overall, Jenny has been a positive force for the lab. Everyone (staff) thought the effort was a success. Jenny was the first dedicated person for the computer lab, which was a huge step forward. Specifically, she continued working with the weekend Passport youth, and did more one-on-one training with preschool staff. The passport is a free access program for low-income Chinatown residents on Saturdays. Jenny also helped implement the&nbsp;E-newsletter.</p>
<p>Jenny completed the first newsletter, built relationships with Saturday Passport youth, collected resources, and worked on the first MIT Astronomy&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>A pretest and post-test was implemented during the first section of CLICK, which underscored the need for CLICK and the quality of the lessons.  The pretest/post-test was a shortened version of the skills portion of the North Carolina Computer Competency Exam.  The mean score on the pretest of the students who completed CLICK was 22.5%, with a high score of 49% and a low score of 6%.  Coming into CLICK the students were lacking the most basic of computer skills.  The mean score on the post-test of those same students was 74.3%, with a high score of 89% and a low score of 60%; a drastic improvement.  On an individual student basis, no student increased his or her score by less than 32 percentage points.  With a mean score increase of 51 percentage points, it is clear that CLICK is both needed and&nbsp;effective.</p>
<p>Some of Chad&#8217;s major accomplishments have been that he successfully introduced the program to Lyon&#8217;s Park Community Center; revised all of the lesson plans and oversaw the development of new lessons for the younger audience at Lyon&#8217;s Park; completely redid the website; instigated the donation of computers from the Franklin Center to Rogers-Herr; put together background and procedural information for future coordinators of CLICK; instigated a relationship with Gary Ybarra in Engineering, which resulted in $5,000 worth of support in the form of assistant coordinators; and successfully set up the program for next year (so the transition is as seamless as&nbsp;possible).</p>
<p>The relationship between CLICK and the Rogers-Herr after-school program has changed in the past and most likely will change in the future.  During the first semester of CLICK there were two sections meeting twice a week.  One section was for students enrolled in the after school program and one section was for students who were not part of the after school program.  Attendance for the after school section was very poor while attendance for the non-after-school section was good.  This was caused, at least in part, by changes in after-school administration and staff shortages at&nbsp;Rogers-Herr.</p>

                    <p>“In tutoring the youth in our CommUNITY Scholars program, I&#8217;ve noticed many have computer homework assignments as early as the 4th grade! Students are asked to write essays and to research cities, nature or historical figures. Most are familiar with the computer from playing computer games or surfing the web but do not know how to use software tools or how to properly position their hands to type. CLICK teaches basic skills to allow students to efficiently complete homework assignments and, ultimately, have more confidence functioning in a growing computer-based world.”<br />
