                    <p>Our goal is to move SCAT into the digital age without leaving behind anyone in the Somerville communities SCAT has been serving for over 25 years: at-risk youth, immigrant communities, low- and middle-income people and organizations who feel ignored by the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media, and seniors looking for a way to make their voices and concerns&nbsp;heard.</p>
<p>VISTA responsibilities&nbsp;include</p>
<p>Planning and policy work:<br />
Research how other public access stations have &#8220;crossed the digital divide&#8221; and implemented computer center programs, as well as programs related to the new digital video technologies, make recommendations to SCAT staff and Board of Directors, and help implement the plan, which would include the purchase of some&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p>Outreach:<br />
Collaboration on the development of messages and programming for the public access channel aimed at making people aware of the new resources and programs at SCAT; development of printed outreach material; personal outreach work, such as visiting service agencies, youth groups, community associations, etc., with a translator when&nbsp;necessary</p>
<p>Training Program:<br />
Design and implementation of a creative program of training on the computer stations, especially related to the Internet and to the multimedia possibilities offered by the world wide web; collaboration with SCAT staff who work with the non-linear editing system in the design and implementation of new multimedia training courses; design and implementation of an advanced training program related to web site design, video streaming,&nbsp;etc.</p>

                    <p>The VISTA worker at SCAT would spearhead the effort to more fully integrate web-based services into SCAT&#8217;s operations. For example, we would like to provide an interactive program schedule on the Website, and provide producers with the option to archive their programs on our website to allow for video-on-demand.  The VISTA would also help us transition to wireless connections for all our office&nbsp;computers. </p>
<p>The VISTA would work with local non-profit organizations on outreach projects, both in video and on the Web. The VISTA would train staff and members in video and web design&nbsp;skills.</p>

                    <p>Christy helped out with programing, including a monthly show called Talking About Somerville. She set up the lighting and manned (womanned) a camera and then edited the peice together putting titles and credits and music to&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>Christy attends local events around Boston interviewing and filming the community. She is currently working with one of our interns to start a show about the &#8220;issues&#8221; facing artists in somerville. She is hoping that anything from the cost of studio space to art education in public schools will be addressed. She has met with the host of another art show we do at SCAT to discuss the format of the&nbsp;show.</p>
<p>Christy is also teaching digital media courses to youth including a class on audio recording and garage band and a program called &#8220;Say Media!&#8221; where youth create music videos, PSAs, and&nbsp;documentaries.</p>
<p>Christy told us, &#8220;I have really enjoyed working with all of them. Some of them have really gotten into their projects and will stay several hours after the camp is through to finish up. they are pretty motivated (they should be, they get paid more than i do to teach, just to show up :) and they are producing some really neat youth media that will appear on our&nbsp;station.&#8221;</p>

                    <p>Intermedia Arts is Minnesota&#8217;s premier multidisciplinary, multicultural organization. Our mission is to by a catalyst that builds understanding among people through&nbsp;art. </p>
<p>PCTV empowers young people to engage with their communities through learning, teaching and making media. For 15 year, PCTV has taught thousands of Minneapolis teens how to make their own TV shows, video diaries, photo essays, webpages and other media&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>The PCTV crew creates a bi-weekly talk show called Our Turn, a online gallery featuring web design, photography and, creative writing called Mixed Visions, video essays, and other media products. These creative projects reflect public concerns and document work by youth in their neighborhoods. Participants of PCTV, and the schools they are selected from, demonstrate a strong commitment to community service and to engaging young people outside the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
<p>Through their involvement with PCTV, participants develop skills in media literacy, video production and design, including techniques in camera operation, sound, lighting, and editing. They also gain abilities in photography and web design and layout. Simultaneously, students begin strengthening community ties and educating others on important issues. By practicing what it means to be part of a media crew and how to fit in roles such as a director, producer, host, editor, and other operations youth find themselves filled with knowledge and skills enhancing their futures in media&nbsp;production.</p>

                    <p>The mission of MATV is to provide the community with access to electronic media, training and channel time so that members have a forum to communicate their ideas, information, and concerns to the community-at-large.

MATV believes in freedom of speech, empowerment, diversity and encouraging public discourse that in turn, strengthens democracy and builds community through the use of&nbsp;media.</p>

                    <p>Through traditional radio broadcasting on WBTN-AM and through new media such as on-line streaming and the building of on-line community forums, the Shires Media Partnership, a non-profit 501 (c) (3), provides large-voice venues for ordinary citizens. Our programming consists of citizen voices, local news, local sports, music and New England professional sports. We serve Bennington and adjacent New York and Massachusetts&nbsp;communities. </p>
<p>The task of Shires Media is to provide the greater Bennington community with a voice for itself. The air space allotted to WBTN-AM by the Federal Communications Commission is seen by us as a community resource with the potential to express and enhance the lives of the people of the community. Through traditional radio broadcasting and through new media such as on-line streaming and the building of on-line community forums, the Shires Media Partnership provides large-voice venues for ordinary&nbsp;citizens.</p>
<p>We presently have radio programs featuring the voice of the local job service, health care shows, and we provide free air time to a variety of government organizations relating to education, employment and labor issues, and local governance On a regular basis, we instruct listeners to dial 2-1-1 for help in life situations (see <a href="http://www.vermont211.org/AN">http://www.vermont211.org/AN</a>). </p>
<p>As well as providing a constant stream of air time to local NGOs and national NGOs to promote various anti-poverty and employment or employment-training programs, Shires Media Partnership helps to ensure that messages from such organizations get disseminated as widely as possible in ways that even the poorest of citizens can access thus helping to bridge the digital&nbsp;divide. </p>
<p>We also provide outreach to local schools, thus assuring that students from all socio-economic backgrounds develop media literacy (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddm3YFfHvgY">North Bennington Graded Schools Radio Station</a>).</p>
