She has been instrumental in designing the website in order to better organize resources and make them available to our states residents. Misty single handedly developed the quick, one click away to community resources for each county.   By July over 43,000 views of needed services were logged on the website, making it the number one resource listings provided to help people.  Misty was also very helpful in marketing the website and making sure individuals were aware of the database.  She helped design informational brochures and distributed them to state organizations to give out.  Lastly Misty was very successful in collecting and distributing valuable resources, of note was a dozen laptops which she not only acquired, but setup up for our programs, increasing the number of people we can&nbsp;help.</p>

                    <p>The last few months have brought about many new challenges for our seasoned VISTA veteran.  Now fully operating under the umbrella of the CMC as my special staff person, Jason has worked on coordinating many of our Public Relations and Marketing efforts.  He has been instrumental in establishing a presentation standard for CMC tours, which are happening more regularly under his watch.   He has created a routine press release mailing that has resulted in continuing media interest and exposure in CMC&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>Jason has been instrumental in coordinating the special events that CMC has sponsored or hosted.  He has willingly shouldered the duty of making appearances at public functions as the CMC representative, recently meeting the esteemed Governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm, the morning after her State of the State&nbsp;Address.  </p>
<p>Other special events include the nationally recognized educational broadcast of the JASON XIV Project. This weeklong workshop was at held at local gathering place Celebration Cinema where Jason led the CMC’s presence, reaching out to the youth of our community.  This high-profile event that was attended by many of Kent County’s eight graders and was broadcast 24/7 on GRTV’s second channel&nbsp;LiveWire.  </p>
<p>Most recently, Jason coordinated a visit from Detective Sullivan (Oprah Winfrey, the Today Show, and others have featured his new book and software), who teaches Cyber-Safety to school children and their parents.  In addition to his interview during drive-time on WYCE 88.1FM, our sponsorship of his visit has resulted in exposure in the Grand Rapids Family&nbsp;Magazine.</p>
<p>Jason has helped the CMC become the production house for the statewide broadband mapping initiative “LinkMichigan.”  He designed the LinkMichigan brochure and has recently taken over the large task of redesigning the “FREE Internet Access” brochure that includes a map, location, and hours for every public Internet Access site in Barry, Ionia, and Kent Counties.  When finished, this brochure will be featured as part of a large marketing campaign funded by the state to promote already existing Internet Access sites and Community Technology Centers in the&nbsp;area.</p>

                    <p>Scott came to BNN in September 2002.  He quickly became a valuable member of the BNN team, assisting with Ed/Out projects that promote BNN services, teaching video production, assisting members with non-linear editing, troubleshooting edit equipment, and producing public service announcements.  Scott has raised the production standards of BNN with his excellent editing and shooting skills.  He has also assisted with print promotions such as newsletters and&nbsp;flyers.</p>
<p>Due to Scott’s excellent production capabilities he was able to complete a number of PSAs, instructional videos, and community based programs for BNN.  Such programs included the 10 part series &#8220;Sister Talk 2,&#8221; a program aimed at African American women to raise awareness of cardiovascular health.  Scott assisted Barbara Barrow-Murray, BNN’s Roxbury Studio Manager, with editing the series.  Scott also played a large role in helping to modernize the look of the channel, creating promotional spots, and helping to improve the channel’s&nbsp;graphics.</p>

                    <p>One of the many capacity building functions Jason has provided has been with media support for a brand new federally funded grant project MOLLIE. Working with the CMC video artist in residence, Jason produced a promotional video that will help insure the future of this fledgling project that is only funded for a year. In addition, he extended GRTV outreach efforts by providing much needed video help to local non-profits who otherwise could not afford&nbsp;it.</p>

                    <p>Jason became a key participant in making our Spring Alliance for Community Media conference a success. With his local connections with artists, Jason put on an art installation that included a live broadcast on Channel 24 Livewire, interactive wireless video transmission, and addressed contemporary issues with technology and community&nbsp;development/education. </p>
<p>His most recent contribution to the future of this organization, relates to his new job description. As Public information officer, Jason is using his graphic design skills to create a new&#8221;image and look&#8221; for the CMC. Now we have someone doing regular press releases, sending out event information to local calendars, and supporting the CMC outreach efforts. The CMC looks forward to Jason&#8217;s second year of&nbsp;service.</p>
