 <title>Blandin Broadband Conference</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/10/blandin-broadband-conference</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s Blandin Broadband Conference spotlights communities across Minnesota that are Cultivating a Culture of Use through ARRA broadband funding. Their goal is ambitious - to create technologically and economically vital rural communities, competing and thriving in the broadband economy, with sustainable broadband adoption, job growth and wealth&amp;nbsp;creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will hear from experts, researchers, students and folks in the field who are creating programs to help boost broadband use in their communities. We will also have time and space for attendees to ask questions and tell their stories, and follow up on the work of the Minnesota Ultra High-Speed Broadband Taskforce to answer the question, &amp;#8220;Where are we now - one year&amp;nbsp;later?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>FUTURE OF MUSIC COALITION PRESENTS D.C. POLICY DAY 2010</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/05/future-of-music-coalition-presents-dc-policy-day-2010</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;National research, education and advocacy nonprofit Future of Music Coalition is pleased to announce its upcoming &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; Policy Day, which takes place at New America Foundation in Washington, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; on May 4,&amp;nbsp;2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has already seen a host of policy developments that will affect the entire music ecosystem — from network neutrality and the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;’s authority to regulate the internet to international copyright concerns to the impact of health care reform on the music community. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; Policy Day 2010 will bring these issues into focus through informed presentations and panel discussions. A live webcast will bring the conversation to a global audience of artists, academics, industry professionals, journalists, music fans and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics to be covered include the hotly debated Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACTA&lt;/span&gt;), the recent Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger, efforts to preserve an open internet and the health insurance landscape for musicians. Policy Day 2010 will also examine how the creative industries are faring under current Washington leadership as we head into a new election&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Communications, Economics and the Internet</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/4/communications-economics-and-the-internet</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://centerformediajustice.org/&quot;&gt;Center for Media Justice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mag-net.org/&quot;&gt;Media Action Grassroots Network&lt;/a&gt; (MAG-Net) have released a new brief on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/full/30526512?access_key=key-193epov1oxn0eq7o48bv&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Migrants and the Open Internet&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As people move in search of work and a better life for themselves and their families, they retain their ties to their communities of origin. This desire for community is as crucial to survival as the need for work, or food and shelter. “The experience of hundreds of years of history has taught us that economic and social survival depends on maintaining the identity, language, and traditions that hold a community together.” [David Bacon - &amp;#8220;Communities without Borders&amp;#8221;] Communication technologies, like email and the Internet, lower the costs that migrants face to keep in touch with their relatives and friends, and help them to remain connected to their home&amp;nbsp;country.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is written in the context of migrants, it can apply to any community, or individuals in search of&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It is migrants, rather than geeks, who have emerged as the ‘most aggressive’ adopters of new communications tools. Dispersed families with strong ties and limited resources have taken to voice-over-internet services, IM and webcams, all of which are cheap or free. They also go online to get news or to download music from home.”&amp;#8212; Swisscom Anthropologist, Stefana&amp;nbsp;Broadbent
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 <title>The Politics Online Conference</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/04/the-politics-online-conference</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of people have been asking me lately, “what can I get out of the conference?” It’s a great question, with a simple answer. If you work in any sector of politics or advocacy, the Politics Online Conference is going to show you how technology and the internet is being used to raise money, build relationships, cultivate contacts, build organizations, increase communication, and much more. In short, the conference will show you how you can use technology to be more effective and more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;
If you already work with state of the art tools, the Politics Online Conference will bring you together with your peers in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, and with some of the brightest minds from New York, California, Texas and more.&lt;br /&gt;
We have two main goals for this conference. First, bring in the nation’s brightest new media practitioners to show and teach conference participants how to use new media to better their organizations and their skills. And second, to bring in innovative people from outside the beltway to infuse new ideas into the realm of politics and technology.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to make it easy for you to figure out where you fit in, we organized the conference in tracks that can be viewed&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>FTC Workshop on the Future of Journalism</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/03/ftc-workshop-on-the-future-of-journalism</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission will hold its second two-day workshop on the future of journalism March 9-10, 2010, in Room 432 of the FTC Headquarters at 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. The agenda and information about the workshop can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/mar9/agenda.pdf&quot; title=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/mar9/agenda.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/mar9/agenda.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers are increasingly turning to the Internet for news and information. Advertisers are moving ads to online sites and scaling back on ad buys as a result of the recession, and news organizations are struggling with large debts they took on during better times. As a result, some are questioning how journalism can survive and thrive in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC’s upcoming workshop will address proposals to better-support and lower the costs of&amp;nbsp;journalism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Changes to copyright law have been suggested as means to require news aggregators to pay fees to news-gathering operations. Panelists will discuss whether such changes would be workable and likely achieve the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;
    * Speakers will consider the potential advantages and disadvantages of combining the interests of for-profit and non-profit investors in hybrid entities, such as so-called L3Cs, as vehicles for new media organizations.&lt;br /&gt;
    * Speakers will address efforts to make government data more accessible and easily managed in ways that may lower the costs of journalism.&lt;br /&gt;
    * Panelists will discuss the wide variety of collaborations that news organizations may use to lower their costs and better support&amp;nbsp;journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, the FTC held the first two-day workshop to consider a wide range of issues, including: the economics of journalism in print and online; the variety of new business and non-profit models for journalism online; factors relevant to the new economic realities for news organizations, such as behavioral and other online targeted advertising, online news aggregators, and bloggers; and ways in which the costs of journalism could be&amp;nbsp;reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop is free and open to the public. Those planning to attend should arrive early to permit time to go through security&amp;nbsp;screening.&lt;/p&gt;
