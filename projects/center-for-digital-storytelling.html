                    <p>The Center for Digital Storytelling,  located in Berkeley, is a community arts center focused on multimedia/digital video training and production. Since the early 1990s, our programs have been exploring the role that personal narrative, storytelling, and new media can play in education, community arts, and social change contexts. We offer beginning-level training workshops in scripting, digital image manipulation, and digital video editing; collaborate with universities and community-based organizations across the U.S. and internationally, to train trainers in our digital storytelling workshop process; and provide one-on-one support for individual multimedia, web, and digital video&nbsp;projects.</p>

                    <p>Project Details<br />
We are seeking a CTCVISTA volunteer to assist with the our communications systems, specifically in regards to the development of a series of Project Initiative websites, and the internal and external communications mechanisms for project planning and development. This work would include web design and management, integration of social networking tools for initiative projects, communication support for project partners, interviews and podcasts with initiative participants, the development of online evaluative forms and&nbsp;database.</p>
<p>How you determined the need for this project<br />
Despite our success over the last several years, we remain a small organization, built around minimal infrastructure. Our capacity to expand was hostage to our model of reactive planning and living from one project to the next. In 2008, our organization sought to re-orient our planning by engaging our board and staff in the development of a series of Strategic Program Initiatives, allowing us to partner more effectively with organizations to create long term, sustained programs using digital storytelling. In order to expand we needed to improve our internal and external communications systems. Working with Laura Hadden and Carrie Cook, our 2008-2009 CTC Vista members, we were able to enhance our communications systems and update our website. We identified several additional projects as part of our initiative&nbsp;planning.</p>
<p>We are hopeful this work will assist with the generation of additional income for our organization via some increased fund-raising as part of our bi-annual open house events, support for initiative grants and in-kind support in technology and volunteers for the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>The evaluation component will be a background goal to the primary goal of communications. We expect Goal 2 of the Volunteer Assignment description to represent less that 15% of the time&nbsp;allotted.</p>
<p>Why this project is&nbsp;timely?</p>
<p>There are six initiatives being developed by staff for 2009-2010. They represent a fundamental shift in our organizational services to the field of non-profits, social service and educational organizations. The process of implementing the initiative process requires the evolution of our communication systems at all levels, as well as significant production and distribution of&nbsp;content.</p>
<p>Here-UR - Urban Research and Service Learning<br />
Working with storymapping, we will partner with organizations around the country to operate a series of residencies within communities to train college students to act as coaches to local mapping&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Witness Tree: Stories for a Changing Planet<br />
Capturing stories about the environment and global climate change, from the perspective of the holders of local&nbsp;wisdom.</p>
<p>Stories-of-Care –<br />
CDS will expand on the success of several projects that explored the<br />
therapeutic applications of digital storytelling with low-income, at-risk<br />
populations affected by violence and other social&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>Bridging Gaps, Supporting Rights<br />
CDS has linked with service organizations in several states to use digital<br />
storytelling as a means of assisting immigrants with transitions in identity, family, language, and&nbsp;citizenship.</p>
<p>Girls and Women in Civic Leadership<br />
CDS will join with service organizations addressing gender-based strategies<br />
to encourage leadership and civic engagement among poor and immigrant women and&nbsp;girls.</p>
<p>For Our Selves, For Our Patients - Stories for Humanizing Healthcare<br />
CDS will continue its ongoing work with healthcare professionals to look at digital storytelling as a evaluative tool for assessing healthcare provision and as a tool for training providers on the provision of quality&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, these initiatives are a critical shift in our approach to planning and growth. The initiatives will be managed through the CDS National Office in Berkeley with the development of outreach strategies, training materials, study guides, promotional and development materials, project management support, and the archiving and post-production of&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>How the project would increase community&nbsp;engagement?</p>
<p>Through this work, we hope that our efforts to support communities across the country will become vastly more effective. We are confident that the methods, practices, curriculum, and stories emerging from these initiatives will be embraced by numerous local, regional, and national partners working directly with the identified communities. The materials that we develop will be also broadly disseminated through partnerships like StoriesforChange.net and our International Day for Sharing Life Stories&nbsp;campaign.</p>
<p>How the project relates to other activities or elements of your organization or&nbsp;community?</p>
<p>As suggested above, the communications systems support will be directly tied to the major priorities of our organization in&nbsp;2009-10.</p>

                    As with all of CDS’ work as a service provider we will make the materials
from our initiatives, case studies, curricula, project development
narratives, and stories available to the field and general public. Our open
source perspective has served us in our 15 years of operation, allowing
1,000s of grassroots, independent organizations and individuals to learn our
methods and applications. With new websites, DVD compilations, digital
stories, articles and surveys will be created from our initiative
implementations. Internally we will enhance our archive database and
post-production management systems, and other information systems servicing a given initiative or the initiative process. Our last three VISTA members have made a huge number of advances for our operations, moving us into the online social networking world and cloud computing, for example, in ways that have revolutionized our organizational functioning.        </div>

                <span class="field-content"><p>CDS has on archive over 6000 digital stories, the largest archive of digital stories in the world representing 16 years of work, and we continue to capture as a national/international organization more than 800 stories per year. The archival system has evolved slowly over the last decade, we can identify the location of the vast majority of stories by the workshop name and date, but we lack a robust system of managing the stories based on meta-data tags and client name. To secure the archive for future generations we need to maintain a robust system, and enhance its capabilities. The capacity to fully integrate effective archival practices into all of our workshops and post-production processes is an invaluable contribution to the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>We are seeking a CTCVISTA member to help develop our Archive and Post Production Technical Support systems. This work would include:<br />
Reviewing existing archive project and systems, research comparable systems in other organizations: enhancing and developing database systems for our movie archive; enhancing and developing post-production systems for managing participant data, update materials for post production process and software tutorials, DVD and Website templates for publication; developing model research/curatorial projects for each initiative process using archive as basis for examining relevant issues in connection to&nbsp;poverty.</p>
<p>The CTC Vista will work with the Supervisor/Technical Director to further develop and enhance two major systems of our organization, the CDS story archive and CDS Post-Production&nbsp;system</p>
<p>The tasks will include:<br />
1. Review existing archive project and systems, research comparable systems in other organizations<br />
2. Enhance and develop database systems for our movie archive.<br />
3. Enhance and develop post-production systems for managing participant data<br />
4. Develop model research/curatorial projects for each initiative process using archive as basis for examining relevant issues in connection to&nbsp;poverty.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Laura Haddon Manages storiesforchange.net, a website for uploading digital stories and disseminating resources to facilitators of digital storytelling. She monitors the website, responds to user questions, helps resolve technical issues, facilitates content development and has implemented an initiative to broaden the steering committee and create an advisory board for the site as part of a strategic initiative to increase website&nbsp;utilization.</p>
<p>She has also worked on Center for Digital Storytelling’s (CDS) Silence Speaks website (<a href="http://www.silencespeaks.org" title="www.silencespeaks.org">www.silencespeaks.org</a>) that focuses on disseminating digital stories of individuals that have survived violence and was in charge of updating content on the International Day for Telling Life Stories site (<a href="http://www.ausculti.org" title="www.ausculti.org">www.ausculti.org</a>). This was an international initiative for promoting the importance of life stories, especially stories of marginalized voices, for developing solidarity and understanding in communities and across&nbsp;borders.</p>
<p>She has also participated in various CDS media and outreach campaigns, and will be involved in strengthening our internal digital story archiving system in order to better serve our workshop&nbsp;participants.</p>

In particular, Laura has been able to leverage past experience in the non-profit sector. She came to us with media and outreach experience and is comfortable framing the work of CDS in terms that other professionals in the sector can easily understand. Her leadership skills have allowed her to go to conferences and speak confidently about how digital storytelling is effective as a tool for personal healing and transformation, as well as effectively communicating new information to a variety of stakeholders, constituencies and key decision makers.&#8221;<br />

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community.
