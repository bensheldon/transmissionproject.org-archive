    <p>The Transmission Project&#8217;s Digital Arts Service Corps was mentioned in a recent news item on the <a href="http://www.knightcomm.org/digital-literacy-skills-critical-to-broadband-adoption/">Knight Commission&#8217;s blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230;young people have a special role to play in times of great change and should be engaged in developing the digital information and communication capacities of local communities (<a href="http://report.knightcomm.org/recommendation-12">recommendation #12</a>). The Commission referred to the potential for creating a domestic version of the <a href="http://www.geekcorps.org/">Geeks Corps</a>, an international nonprofit that works to expand access to the Internet around the world. There are several examples of such projects happening in the United States already, including the <a href="&amp;.html">Digital Arts Service Corps</a> and the <a href="http://publicmediacorps.org/">Public Media Corps</a> in development by the National Black Programming Consortium&nbsp;(<span class="caps">NBPC</span>).
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Transmission Project believes that all people have a role in the creation of a robust and diverse media ecology. The Digital Arts Service Corps engages people of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life in building the capacity of nonprofit organizations the use media and technology to strengthen communities. Our Corps members have aged from 17 to 70 and each one brought unique skills, perspectives and experience to their service. Youth is but one barrier to inclusion in the planning and construction of a digital&nbsp;society.</p>

		  </h3>

	
  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>On Monday we created some <a href="2/btop-applications-and-awards-by-state.html">graphics illustrating the total grant amounts</a> that were requested for projects by state. New awards have sinced been announced, so I updated that graphic&nbsp;below.</p>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/funded-2-22-10.png" alt="BTOP funds updated for 2/22/10" /></p>
<p>The United States is slowly filling it. We&#8217;re using a new algorithm to draw the map, so things should be a little clearer as to where funding is (and isn&#8217;t)&nbsp;going. </p>
<h4>Grant Requests by&nbsp;Need</h4>
<p>I don&#8217;t want this data to become a horse-race of trailing zeros, so I thought it would be interesting to weight the dollar somehow. Per-capita is interesting, but because these grants are intended for <em>opportunity</em> I want to throw poverty values into the mix. According to the <span class="caps">FCC</span>, <a href="http://www.zerodivide.org/blog/margaret/fcc_survey_finds_cost_and_digital_literacy_main_barriers_broadband_adoption">affordability is one of the key barriers to broadband adoption</a>. So I calculated the grant amounts by &#8220;per-capita living below the poverty level&#8221; using the Census Bureau&#8217;s <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/states/NST-ann-est.html<br />
">2009 estimated state populations</a> and the <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GRTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-_col=disp_order&amp;-CONTEXT=grt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_R1701_US30&amp;-_source=mdr&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=US-30&amp;-_lang=en">2008 American Community Survey estimates for percent of people below the poverty level</a>. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Per-capita in poverty&#8221; has been calculated by multiplying the state&#8217;s total population by the percentage of that population determined to be living beneath the federal poverty level. Dollar amounts are then divided by this population in poverty to give an average dollar-figure for each person living beneath the poverty level in that state. In the maps below, darker colors imply larger dollar amounts and lighter colors imply smaller&nbsp;ones.</p>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/totals-poverty.png" alt="Grant Requests adjusted per-capita in poverty" /></p>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/totals_tiny.png" alt="Unadjusted Total Grant Requests" style="float:right" /></p>
<p>This is all grants that have been requested and now things look interesting compared to the unadjusted totals (smaller map at right). All of a sudden the heartland has some color; behemoths California and Texas have paled and New York now has company in the&nbsp;Northeast. </p>
<p>New York state requested the most amount of project funding at just over a $1B. When adjusted per-capita in poverty though, New York is asking for just $398 per person in poverty. By the per-capita in poverty measure, New York only ranks 20th between Georgia (requesting nearly $600M total) and South Carolina (requesting just $275M&nbsp;total). </p>
<p>Alaska, ranking #1 in per-capita in poverty (4th in total grants at $870M), asks for nearly $15,000 per person in poverty&#8212;more than the Federal poverty level itself a family of 2. In 2nd is Hawaii at $1,800 per-capita in poverty (but 23rd in total&nbsp;requests).</p>
<p>Ranked last, Virginia trails asking for just $86 per head in poverty, though they rank 42nd in total requests ($69M). On the other hand, the District of Columbia is ranked 43rd in total requests ($63M), but ranked 11th per-capita in poverty at $612 per person in poverty&nbsp;.</p>
<p>One more: Kentucky. Kentucky has the second highest percentage of population living beneath the poverty line at 17.3% (they are tied with Arkansas and Louisiana). They rank 36th in their overall grant requests ($106M) but 46th in grants per-capita in poverty ($143 per person in poverty). On-the-ground issues are complex, but Kentucky is perhaps one example of a state not benefiting according to its need from this&nbsp;process.</p>
<h4>Awards adjusted for&nbsp;poverty</h4>
<p>Using the per-capita in poverty adjustments, let&#8217;s look at&nbsp;awards. </p>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/awarded-poverty.png" alt="Grant Awards adjusted per-capita in poverty" /></p>
<p>Alaska is still quite the outlier. So far they&#8217;ve been awarded $69M total, which is $1,200 per-capita in poverty (granted their population in poverty is less than 6,000 people). Every single state except for Hawaii and Alaska itself, <em>requested</em> less per-capita in poverty (much&nbsp;less). </p>
<p>Following Alaska is West Virginia at $422 per-capita in poverty ($130M in total awards). and South Dakota at $202 per-capita (just $20M in total&nbsp;awards). </p>
<p>Not all Round 1 awards have been announced, only $700M total out of an expected $1.4B (and another $2.6B for Round 2). But so far the average award per-capita in poverty is $79, while the median is just $12. This compares to the total grant awards averaging $24M; the median being less than half-that at $11.5M. Geography aside, there are some clear disparities in awards on a state-by-state&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>I could analyze this all day, but you can <a href="http://transmissionproject.org/sites/transmissionproject.org/files/BTOP Application Poverty Data_2-22-10.xls<br />
">download the summary tables (xls)</a> generated from our <a href="../2009/11/ntia-broadband-access-data.html"><span class="caps">BTOP</span>/<span class="caps">BIP</span> application spreadsheets</a>.</p>
<h4>Identifying Applicants by Email&nbsp;Domain</h4>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/btop-applicants-email.png" alt="Applicants by Email Domain" /></p>
<p>Those last sections involved a lot of dollar-signs, so I want to transition to looking at the applicants themselves. We have two different data sets: the application database and a separate survey the Transmission Project put together with the help of the New America&nbsp;Foundation.</p>
<p>Of 1987 applications total, there were 1265 unique applicants. By analyzing applicants&#8217; email addresses, we can get a general sense of the institutions from which they are&nbsp;applying.</p>
<p>The chart above breaks down how many applicants there were based upon the <span class="caps">TLD</span> (top level domain) of their email address. .Gov and .Edu are clearcut and limited expressly to those agencies. Many state agencies use .Us. .Com, .Org and .Net have defined purposes (Commercial, Nonprofit and Network providers), though these definitions are not regulated. So the flaws are that not all agencies use the proper <span class="caps">TLD</span> and those using Free Webmail (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail) will show up as&nbsp;.com. </p>
<p>This is all applicants, though it could be interesting to break them down by program area (Public Computing, Sustainable Broadband and Networking). That will have to be a project for another day&nbsp;though.</p>
<h4>Applicants as&nbsp;Partnerships</h4>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/btop-partnerships.png" alt="Applicant Partnerships" /></p>
<p>From our survey, we asked applicants if their application was a result of partnership with other entities. Interestingly, nearly 70% of applicants surveyed proposed a partnership for their project. Nearly 60% of those partnerships involved a public entity, which contrasts slightly with the email analysis above. This could be a result of a large number of primary applicants being private entities that partnered with public ones, a failure of the email domain analysis, or just a generously worded survey question. Just the predominance of applications involving partnerships is a positive sign for the field and speaks to the gathering power of scaled-up&nbsp;grantmaking.</p>

  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>At the end of January, the <a href="http://broadbandusa.gov"><span class="caps">NTIA</span></a> notified more than 1300 applicants that their projects would not be funded. This still left more than 500 project applications still pending for funding. At the time, only $250M for 31 projects had been announced; as more information about Round 2 has become available, we now know that Round 1 will total $1.4 billion in grants to be announced by the end of February (this&nbsp;week!). </p>
<p>In order to learn more about the process and inform Round 2 applicants&#8212;there is a scant 2 weeks between Round 1&#8217;s anticipated announcements and the closing of the Round 2 application period&#8212;we sent a brief survey to project applicants who had their project declined for funding and those whose application was still pending. Of the 800 unique applicants in our survey pool, we received 217 responses between February 10 and February 18,&nbsp;2010.</p>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll be sharing information about the project feedback process: public response notices, due diligence, and letters of&nbsp;non-funding.</p>
<p><em>This analysis is done in collaboration with the <a href="http://oti.newamerica.net/publications/special/btop_and_bip_broadband_funding_application_guides_25556">New America Foundation&#8217;s Open Technology Initiative</a>.</em></p>
<h4>Public Notice&nbsp;Responses</h4>
<p>For 30 days beginning in late September, 2009 the <span class="caps">NTIA</span> allowed public comments on the nearly 1900 <span class="caps">BTOP</span> project applications. According to <a href="../2009/11/ntia-broadband-access-data.html">record</a>, <strong>47% of projects received at least 1 public response</strong>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not a single Public Computing Center or Sustainable Broadband Adoption proposal (39% of all applications) received a Public Response Notice. Only network deployment projects (Last Mile and Middle Mile) received&nbsp;comments.</p>
<p>From our surveys, these notices were overwhelmingly filed by existing network providers and of a critical nature. Of survey particants who received a Public Response Notice, <strong>90% of those notices came from current network operators</strong>. The nature of their comments was similar, some respondents characterizing them as &#8220;canned filings&#8221; and &#8220;Standard Generic Comments&#8221;: 3/4ths of survey responders&#8217; comments claimed the proposed areas were not underserved or not rural. The shotgun nature of these notices can be witnessed by one public response notice submitted &#8220;ironically, by one of the [project]&nbsp;partners&#8221;. </p>
<p>Only notice summaries, not including attachments and maps, have not been made public. This makes verifying the notices&#8217; claims&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>Other responses included: &#8220;Others asking for grants to do the same work in the same area&#8221; and &#8220;There were weak arguments from other local vendors who clearly do not want the&nbsp;competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the bright side, <strong>2 survey responders said they received a notice of support for their project</strong>.</p>
<h4>Due&nbsp;Diligence</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s understandable that an agency making available $4B in grants wants to follow up with grantees to ensure the honesty and integrity of those projects. And with nearly 1900 applications, it can take some&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/btop-due-diligence.png" alt="BTOP Due Diligence Percentages" /></p>
<p>Of the 1300 applicants whose applications were declined for funding, 94% of those surveyed did <em>not</em> receive due diligence prior to receiving notice of non-funding. <strong>Of those whose applications are still pending, 60% of those surveyed still have <em>not</em> received due diligence correspondence or contact from <span class="caps">NTIA</span>&nbsp;representatives.</strong></p>
<p>Of those applicants who did receive Due Diligence followup, the nature seems to be, as one survey response put it &#8220;A broad array across the spectrum of&nbsp;categories&#8221;:</p>
<p> - budget, cash flows and project costs<br />
 - the methodology for determining unserved areas<br />
 - pricing and the sustainability of the business model<br />
 - demographics<br />
 - program usage<br />
 - environmental checklist/questionaire<br />
 - network&nbsp;architecture</p>
<p>One responder was quite&nbsp;comprehensive:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>We were requested to provide all Step2-Due Diligence documents including organizing docs, evidence of all indebtedness, environmental checklist and maps, depreciation schedule. We also had a site visit with a few topics being discussed, a few maps reviewed,&nbsp;etc.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>Rejection&nbsp;Letters</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to put a pleasant spin on correspondence applicants received informing them their project would not be funded, but it&#8217;s easier to call them what they are: rejection letters. From what we know, there wasn&#8217;t much else to the letters than that: <strong>70% of our survey responders received no explicit deficiency or rationale to their rejection.</strong> The specific language was &#8220;Your application was evaluated by objective reviewers and did not score high enough to move forward in the review&nbsp;process.&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of the 30% minority of survey responders who did receive a rationale, they can be summarized as<br />
- incomplete application or lack of supporting documents<br />
- insufficient match<br />
- area could not be verified as rural or&nbsp;underserved</p>
<p>For each of these rationales, there was at least someone who felt their application was misjudged:<br />
 - &#8220;We did not include two forms the application asked for; which was untrue.&#8221;<br />
 - &#8220;Failure to document 20% match when in fact a 30% match was clearly documented in the application&#8221;<br />
 - &#8220;50 miles from an area that was deemed out of bounds, but not according to the information we had&nbsp;available&#8221;</p>
<h4>What can Round 2 Applicants learn from&nbsp;this?</h4>
<p>Despite the transparency of applicant proposals, the evaluation process itself remains opaque to the detriment of Round 2&nbsp;applicants.</p>
<p>We asked how Round 1 applicants would adapt their proposal for Round 2. The typical response from those with applications still pending was &#8220;based on the reason Round 1 was denied&#8221;. This will be&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>In light of the short window between Round 1 announcements&#8212;and their dearth of information&#8212;and the Round 2 application deadline, we recommend applicants move forward with their Round 2 application without the expecation of meaningful feedback from Round&nbsp;1.</p>

  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>We crunched some of our <a href="../2009/11/ntia-broadband-access-data.html"><span class="caps">BTOP</span> proposal data</a> over the weekend and all this week we&#8217;ll be sharing some interesting data about Round 1 <em>and</em> and some recommendations for Round 2 applications. It&#8217;s cat-and-mouse with the <span class="caps">NTIA</span> since as soon as we analyse the data, they make some new announcements. A plus at least is that every new announcement implies that we&#8217;re moving forward on awarding money to projects and&nbsp;communities.</p>
<p>The following data is as of February 18, 2010, though some <a href="3077162.993.html">new announcements</a> (and another $350 million) were made that very afternoon and are not included&nbsp;here. </p>
<p><em>This analysis is done in collaboration with the <a href="http://oti.newamerica.net/publications/special/btop_and_bip_broadband_funding_application_guides_25556">New America Foundation&#8217;s Open Technology Initiative</a>.</em></p>
<h4>Where did we&nbsp;start?</h4>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/totals_sm.png" alt="BTOP - All Projects" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">colored map</a> above shows total <span class="caps">BTOP</span> grant application amounts by state. Darker states requested more money for projects within that state, lighter states requested less. For example dark blue Alaska applied for $954 million of <span class="caps">BTOP</span> project grants (the most) while light blue Rhode Island only $31 million dollars of grants (the least). These are not awards, but initial&nbsp;applications.</p>
<h4>What has been&nbsp;awarded?</h4>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/funded-sm.png" alt="BTOP - Funded" /></p>
<p>As you can see by mapping the dollar amounts awarded per state, there is still a broad swath of America awaiting funds. To be fair, there are still 550 proposals pending that should be announced by the end of the&nbsp;month. </p>
<h4>Where are applications&nbsp;pending?</h4>
<p><img src="../../sites/transmissionproject.org/files/pending-sm.png" alt="BTOP - Pending" /></p>
<p>During the past 2 months, the <span class="caps">NTIA</span> has informed more than 1300 applicants that their applications would not be funded. This still leaves a good number of applications and some interesting shifts in where grants are being requested and <em>could</em> be&nbsp;funded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some notes:</strong> The numbers above are unadjusted grant dollar amounts. It would probably be more meaningful to adjust them per-capita, or even by rural population or population living under the poverty line. Also, multi-state projects have had their requested amounts divided equally between those&nbsp;states.</em></p>

    <p>No one is immune to making mistakes.<br />
And I have to express admiration to those who will admit it, learn from it, and make the changes necessary to respond to it.<br />
But to make mistakes and changes at such a high level and talk about it, well, that&#8217;s like superhero stuff to me.<br />
Take this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/14/AR2010021403550.html">announcement</a> from the White&nbsp;House:</p>
<blockquote><p>
White House officials are retooling the administration&#8217;s communications strategy to produce faster responses to political adversaries, a more disciplined focus on President Obama&#8217;s call for &#8220;change&#8221; in Washington and an increasingly selective use of the president&#8217;s&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The messaging adjustments are the result of an end-of-the-year analysis in which White House advisers said the president&#8217;s communications team had not taken the initiative often enough and had allowed drawn-out debates in Congress, and relentless criticism by Republicans, to drown out his&nbsp;message.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a political move.  But what do any of us do for our organizations that isn&#8217;t, in essence, a political move to build support and resources for us to do our work better?  We constantly hone our messages, revise our plans, and change our methods.<br />
If we keep our eye on the long view, know why we do what we do, and admit why we&#8217;re doing it, we can build movements built on trust and openness.<br />
Administration, I say to you: Keep on&nbsp;learning. </p>

  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>I&#8217;ve been taking time to digest the The Broadband Coalition&#8217;s report on <em><a href="http://www.jointcenter.org/publications_recent_publications/media_and_technology/expanding_and_accelerating_the_adoption_use_of_broadband_throughout_the_economy">Expanding and Accelerating the Adoption <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Use of Broadband Throughout the Economy</a></em>. What I appreciate most about the report is the systemic approach it takes: leveraging existing community infrastructure, programs and organizations while expanding their capacity to include broadband adoption and&nbsp;use. </p>
<p>I think the approach and recommendations from this report could quite easily be adapted to other media access and literacy&nbsp;campaigns.</p>
<p>The report defines Broadband accelerators as programs&nbsp;that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
•	Promote and assist affordable home computer and Internet access.<br />
•	Are embedded in established community social and institutional networks.<br />
•	Are “High-touch” – based on personal interactions and relationships.<br />
•	Provide continuing formal as well as peer support to the new adopter through several critical stages of the “adoption curve”: engage, train, equip and support.<br />
•	Integrate basic broadband adoption with other strongly motivating opportunities, e.g. employment, education, public safety, healthcare needs, civic and neighborhood&nbsp;improvement.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This approach can be well-informed by the Community Technology Centers movement: while many centers were founded on offering <em>computer</em> training, they evolved into <em>service</em> centers specializing in employment, education, etc. Broadband adoption, like computer literacy before it, is a means, not an&nbsp;end.</p>
<p>To resource these changes, the report makes some key policy recommendations at each level of&nbsp;government:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At a national level, foster evergreen funding sources to support community efforts needed to help nonsubscribers become confident and effective technology&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>Encourage states to adopt policies and strategies that facilitate and support the building of community-based broadband access and adoption&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>Encourage local initiatives and local funding to support community-based broadband access and adoption&nbsp;programs.
</p></blockquote>
