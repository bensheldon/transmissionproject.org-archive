                    <p>Our Community Media Center is a cooperative of public access, nonprofit media including, GRTV, WYCE, GrandNet, the Grand Rapids Institute for Information Democracy (GRIID), the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Educaiton (MOLLIE) and the Wealthy Theater.  We provide individuals and groups with access to the tools training and means of transmission they need to join our mission of &#8220;Building community through&nbsp;media&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our VISTA member will assist in video and other media productions, primarily with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE).  MoLLIE works in large part with youth in the local financially struggling school system to help teachers fulfill curriculum requirements while also teaching the students the skills of video production using digital video cameras and iBook computers for&nbsp;editing.</p>

                    <p>Over the course of Sarah&#8217;s Vistaship she has been instrumental in working with our various youth training programs providing a wide variety of skills. She was responsible for helping students make the best videos possible and teaching them to think critically about media and media messages. She took the initiative to outreach to communities we hadn&#8217;t worked with in the past including GLBT and the Triangle Foundation, and solidified relationships with them and our organization. She helped plan a film festival and worked on several video installations dealing with issues such as the war and discrimination. In addition, Sarah has helped out in our theater by operating the lighting board for concerts, selling tickets and running concessions. She teaches video production and editing classes to our members and so much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Here is a list of projects Sarah was involved in during her VISTA&nbsp;year:</p>
<p>1.Allegan County Community Mental Health: produced, shot and edited a documentary about the stigma of mental&nbsp;illness.</p>
<p>2. G.E.T. Girls Empowering Together: since January worked with a group of High School girls in a leadership mentoring program to mentor, produce, shot and edit a documentary about the program, “Breaking the Surface,” available for viewing at <a href="http://www.archive.org" title="www.archive.org">www.archive.org</a></p>
<p>3. The MOLLIE Club: a weekly video club for students in middle School that provides an opportunity for them to come in and Make&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>4. MOLLIE (Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education): Went to area schools and non-profits teaching youth how to produce, shoot and edit&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>5. Real Pride: helped start the planning process for a film and documentary series about LGBT&nbsp;issues.</p>

They had a really fancy dinner with a lot of area dignitaries in attendance when the documentary was screened for the first time. Many commented to us afterwards about what a great project this was and committed to funding another program this year.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>Our core media arts education program, The Lab, is a free after-school workshop that challenges Brooklyn high school students to produce short documentary videos about their lives.  This program incorporates lessons in literacy (story-telling, scripting, editing), self-esteem and tolerance, technology and media literacy within the context of 1:1 mentoring with professional&nbsp;filmmakers.</p>
<p>The Lab Assistant will work with the Lab Coordinator, Directors, and other staff to enhance the capacity of The Lab, Reel Impact, and all other programs of Reel Works Teen Filmmaking. Duties include, but are not limited&nbsp;to</p>
<p>- media arts&nbsp;instruction;</p>
<p>- maintenance of technical equipment and media&nbsp;collection;</p>
<p>- assisting with the recruitment and training of volunteer filmmaker&nbsp;mentors;</p>
<p>- developing and maintaining relationships with schools, community centers, and neighborhoods in Brooklyn served by Reel&nbsp;Works;</p>
<p>- developing a youth advisory&nbsp;board;</p>
<p>- assisting with the distribution/outreach and public&nbsp;relations;</p>
<p>- and performing various administrative duties as&nbsp;needed.</p>

                    <p>In a lab used mainly by young people on a daily basis we run into many technical/equipment malfunctions that oftentimes have no explanation. Reel Works Teen Filmmaking operates on a &#8220;shoe-string&#8221; budget and would not have been as successful in the past year had it not been for Micheil&#8217;s superior troubleshooting skills. Oftentimes, the members of our skeleton staff would attempt to trouble shoot errors while simultaneously running other programs and teaching a class - making for a very hectic and crazy work day. The days we were fortunate enough to work with Micheil were always the most productive. The young people in our program owe a lot of their stress-free success to&nbsp;Micheil.</p>

                    <p>As the purpose of the AmeriCorps*VISTA program is to provide useful outreach to local communities, our participants echoed their sentiment through visible outreach and service projects. One example I am reminded of was the special PBS viewing of “Every Mother’s Son,” coordinated by Mr. Bentinez.  The event called for local law enforcement agents and community members to come together in support of the idea of social change, justice and a forum for communication and healing.  This project used the power of media and the passion of human nature to discuss the realities of police brutality in New York City. This event is also an example of a sustainable solution effort and the ability of change.<br />

                    <p>James Fishwick&#8217;s VISTA assignment began with a focus on development support for the Greater Boston Broadband Network, support for the growth of the College&#8217;s technology use by faculty and staff and in programs related to the Community Media and Technology program, and CTC VISTA project web site support.  Over the course of his last six months, James continued to do very impressive work in all three areas and concluded his term of service by becoming the project&#8217;s VISTA Leader for a second year of service and attending VISTA Leader training at the end of&nbsp;August.</p>

                    <p>James took on major responsibility for CBC coordination, project web site development, and the monthly pilot cable and web cast &#8220;First Tuesday&#8221; program, undertaking the latter while serving as the Assistant Producer.Overall project coordination involved assisting with monthly meeting arrangements and follow through with subcommittee needs and support.  Web site development included not only design and technical maintenance but content development as well. As Assistant Producer for &#8220;First Tuesday,&#8221; James undertook a wide range of tasks insuring smooth program production, including serving as live-time chat coordinator and on-camera contributor, set design, plant, and web cast coordination, and post-production&nbsp;assistance.</p>
<p>With regard to the College, James continued to provide a good range of support to individual faculty and programs and helped give visible, tangible testimony of the value of the Community Media and Technology program.  In addition to special help to five faculty/programs, James assisted the CPCS IT Task Force, a committee dedicated to a thorough review of the current IT landscape at UMass and its effect on the college. The task force makes recommendations to the college on how to move on various IT issues, especially the establishment and subsequent development of the Clark Taylor Center. James has served as secretary to the committee and has helped to facilitate discussions on needs for the Center with CPCS&nbsp;faculty.</p>
<p>Finally, as the web master for the CTC VISTA Project itself (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista</a>), James initiated a number of design and content contributions that have contributed to the project&#8217;s aesthetic and programmatic presentation for VISTAs, supervisors, and the general public.  His work with the VISTAs in encouraging and helping them develop their own web pages and resources, along with his moderation of the metroBoston and national CTC VISTA member electronic discussion lists and general communication have given him a major leadership status among his fellow VISTAs and in the overall&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>Scott came to BNN in September 2002.  He quickly became a valuable member of the BNN team, assisting with Ed/Out projects that promote BNN services, teaching video production, assisting members with non-linear editing, troubleshooting edit equipment, and producing public service announcements.  Scott has raised the production standards of BNN with his excellent editing and shooting skills.  He has also assisted with print promotions such as newsletters and&nbsp;flyers.</p>
<p>Due to Scott’s excellent production capabilities he was able to complete a number of PSAs, instructional videos, and community based programs for BNN.  Such programs included the 10 part series &#8220;Sister Talk 2,&#8221; a program aimed at African American women to raise awareness of cardiovascular health.  Scott assisted Barbara Barrow-Murray, BNN’s Roxbury Studio Manager, with editing the series.  Scott also played a large role in helping to modernize the look of the channel, creating promotional spots, and helping to improve the channel’s&nbsp;graphics.</p>

<p>Goal 1:  Set up and operate CTC<br />
Goal 2:  Provide computer skills/ English skills to target population.<br />
Goal 3:  Assist community groups in setting up CTCs.<br />
Goal 4:  Produce a video on BPSOS CTCs/Survivor Services Dept.<br />

                    <p>Between the months of September and December, I worked with my fellow VISTA, Co Kim Oanh, and my supervisor, Bach Pham, to reaffirm community contacts by recruiting volunteers, outreaching to prospective clients, and acquiring space for a CTC.  While Bach worked with BPSOS’s IT guy to acquire computers, I focused on recruiting volunteers to teach a series of Computer Literacy/ESL classes to current BPSOS clients. Through websites and phone calls, we recruited a small group of 4-5 volunteers that agreed to teach ESL/Computer Literacy combo&nbsp;classes.</p>
