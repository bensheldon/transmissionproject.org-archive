                    We will prepare a white paper for distribution to the AIRs (Association of Information and Referal Systems) listserv, this white paper will describe the lessions we&#039;ve learned and the tangible products we have created. If we should fail to meet our success critera (above) we will discuss our errors and the external factors that caused us to fail. (new!)

LESSONS WE HOPE TO LEARN
1) It is possible to provide high quality information
and referral services over the web at a much
lower cost than is currently done through call
centers.

2) A bottom-up, participatory, grass-roots approach to letting
people know about community services is as effective or
more effective than a centralized, top-down one.

TANGIBLE PRODUCTS WE HOPE TO CREATE

Software that other grassroots organizations can install

Documentation on using the software and building support for it&#039;s use.        </div>

<p>GOALS:<br />
add features<br />
improve packaging<br />
improve user friendliness<br />
add&nbsp;infrastructure</p>
<p>An example of a new feature would be a report that lists the services that are not available in a given&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>We hope to have our software apt-get installable on Debian/Ubuntu Learning the Debian package system is a prerequisite for this&nbsp;goal</p>
<p>To achieve even better user friendliness, we do lots of usability testing. We watch people use our software, change things they are struggling with and&nbsp;re-test.</p>
<p>Infrastructure includes unit tests, integration tests, documentation, little utility scripts (like&nbsp;&#8220;clean&#8221;)</p>

The current plan is to divide their time on structured tangible work like making networking phone calls and unstructured work like figuring out how to get more of the public using our sites. The VISTA will attend meetings of groups of agencies, demo our software, develop ways to increase viewership, attend public events like festivals, make followup networking phone calls to agency representatives after meetings, and contact agency <span class="amp">&amp;</span> program contacts to get them to update or add entries to the&nbsp;database.</p>
<p>- Increase the number of organizations putting their records into our databases<br />
- Increase the number of people searching for information on our sites<br />
- Document a reproducible process for getting organizations to put their info on our&nbsp;sites.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Carolyn has brought in approximately $3,000 in undesignated donations, almost reaching her goal of $5000. Working with board members and other staff, Carolyn scheduled coffee or lunch meetings with past and potential supporters and asked them for money. Carolyn created a database of past and potential donors of more than 300 members. Carolyn also organized and ran a fundraising Tea that brought in approximately $1000. Considering our past best year for individual donations was about $700, this is quite a leap&nbsp;forward. </p>
<p>The Community Software lab now has the infrastructure for soliciting donations and for putting on fund-raising events. We also now have an organizational culture that values fundraising. To insure we can continue, our board and permanent staff have worked with Carolyn on fund-raising setup and implementation and pledged to continue when she leaves. Remaining work includes refining our presentation for different potential donors. We need to cultivate donors outside our existing&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>When Carolyn started we realized that her work should fit into a larger plan, a plan that we had not yet created. Carolyn has contributed to our business planning efforts and our draft/working business plan document. Carolyn has done planning work on an un-conference we are exploring putting on with another organization. Carolyn recruited somebody who is proving to be one of our better board members. Carolyn helped write two&nbsp;grants.</p>

<p>    * Free software (Linux, Perl, Apache, etc.)<br />
    * Below market salaries<br />
    * Volunteers<br />
    *&nbsp;Grants</p>
<p>The grant writer VISTA member&nbsp;will:</p>
<p>A) Make fundraising contacts and create fundraising&nbsp;processes</p>
<p>B) Develop and maintain relationships with&nbsp;funders</p>
<p>C) Establish ongoing donor&nbsp;database</p>
<p>D) Create calendar of grant&nbsp;deadlines</p>
<p>E) Write&nbsp;grants</p>
<p>The Community Software Lab (CSL) has never had a grant writing/fundraising position.  Their director and staff members are volunteers.  With 100,000 and the establishment of ongoing fundraising contacts and processes as the year-end goal, a grant writer will enable CSL to support the full-time salaries of its director and staff.  This will dramatically enhance the services CSL provides to their&nbsp;clients.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Originally, Eric&#8217;s primary goal was to raise money writing grants. His secondary goals were to create a process for us to continue successful grant writing, to get a handle on our bookkeeping and accounting, particularly in regard to presenting our finances to funders. We had very limited success with the grant writing and other pressing needs. Eric shifted the focus of his work to supervising interns, expanding mvhub, doing paperwork for the government, creating a process to do that paperwork in the future and looking at non-grant writing funding&nbsp;opportunities.</p>
<p>We do have, however, a good start on a plan to get a better program. One of Eric&#8217;s clear successes was expanding <a href="http://mvhub.com" title="http://mvhub.com">http://mvhub.com</a> into Lawrence. We were struggling here. In Lowell we know a lot of people. A quick reminder phone call was enough to get people to add their information This didn&#8217;t work in Lawrence where we knew few non-profit people. Eric broke the bottleneck. He asked people to fax us their brochures. He typed the brochures into our database and got people to confirm their records and got our stalled project moving. Before Eric arrived, our workers were contractors, volunteers or Americorps/VISTA members. We didn’t need a payroll system. Eric figured out the complexity of state and federal payroll taxes for our first&nbsp;employee.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>SINGLE NETWORK-WIDE USERNAME (LDAP SERVER)<br />
This project moved us from a system that involved either multiple passwords for a user to remember for our different services, or synchronizing files between machines. Under the new system, users have one password, there is only a single box housing all the user information, and data about users is easily associable with their account, allowing us to do organization-wide address books and the&nbsp;like. </p>
<p>BETTER EMAIL AND SPAM FILTERING (EMAIL SERVER)<br />
After the LDAP Server, our email service was transferred off of the one box we were running all our services off of and moved to a much more powerful dedicated box.  The new system involved keeping all the information about email accounts in the LDAP Server, the beginnings of a unified login page for all our services, and better Spam and virus filtering where Spam is quarantined online rather than sent to the user. Currently, our Spam filtering is about 99.18% efficient, with a false positive rate of&nbsp;0.31% </p>
<p>SYSTEM SCRIPTS<br />
Chris designed a handful of different Perl scripts to automate and / or facilitate the administration of our systems.  These included a reworking of out account creation script to handle the new LDAP Server, various small backup and synchronization scripts, and scripts to make sure that current configuration files and the files in our backup were in&nbsp;sync. </p>
<p>CREATED BACKUP SYSTEM FOR SYSTEM CONFIGURATION<br />
Although we had checklists for setting our many systems up in the case that they failed and needed to be rebuilt, the instructions were complicated, and were not always compete.  With this project, we attempted to put all the important configuration files into a backup system so that if a machine died, the configuration files could be replaced without rewriting them from&nbsp;scratch.</p>
<p>FINDING AN OPEN SOURCE ALTERNATIVE TO MS EXCHANGE<br />
Implementation has just stared.  Exchange Server is a powerful group collaboration and organization tool, but it is not aimed at small non-profits.  It is non-free software and has high costs.  The goal of this project is to take one of the open source alternatives to Exchange and implement it for one of our clients.  The system will allow our client to use the full powers of their MS Outlook email&nbsp;client. </p>
<p>BECOMING A DEBIAN LINUX DEVELOPER<br />
Chris is getting certified as a Debian GNU/Linux developer. As a Debian developer, Chris can add software we wrote to the Debian software repository. The hundreds of thousands of people using Debian GNU/Linux can then easily install our&nbsp;software.</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
