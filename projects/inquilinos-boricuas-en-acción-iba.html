        Project Description:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Kevin further developed a youth web magazine project based on the project that CTC VISTA Alison Hale had started the year before. The name of the project is: Teen Limitz. Here youth participants wrote stories, took pictures, and learned many skills: Web publishing, Design, Macromedia Dreamweaver, HTML, Flash, and Adobe Photoshop. Kevin also taught a web design class for adults in both English and Spanish at the&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>Kevin is to provide tech support to residents in the Villa Victoria neighborhood that were given computers through IBA’s computer donation program.  He has made over 50 visits to fix software and hardware problems.  He also developed a training manual to help residents learn about providing Tech Support.  The guide addresses all the common problems that residents face and shows how to fix them. This guide is available online: <a href="http://www.iba-etc.org/tl/supporttraining.doc" title="http://www.iba-etc.org/tl/supporttraining.doc">http://www.iba-etc.org/tl/supporttraining.doc</a> (29&nbsp;MB)</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Kevin successfully recruiting the three teens that had previously worked with Alison.  He then taught them how to build their own webpages and link them together.  He helped them with their writing and editing.  By working with WiredWoods, he was able to get help with the curriculum development and tracking as well as get digital cameras loaned to the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>The teens can now say with confidence that they know how to develop and maintain a complete website. They can also build their own pages, and enter into more advanced training programs. This could potentially be a way for these kids to find high-paying&nbsp;jobs.</p>
<p>Kevin also taught a dozen adults how to make their own pages. They were excited to learn and help each other&nbsp;learn. </p>
<p>Kevin was very patient and understanding with the residents.  On each of the site visits to fix residents’ computers, I heard that he took time to teach residents about the computers and encourage them to take more&nbsp;classes.</p>

He would knock on their [teen volunteers&#8217;] doors if they were late and work around their schedule to get things done.  By the time Kevin left, I felt the teens had gotten a valuable experience from him.&#8221;<br />

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
