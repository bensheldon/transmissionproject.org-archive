 <title>The CTC VISTA Project has a new name </title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2009/7/the-ctc-vista-project-has-a-new-name</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;BOSTON - The CTC VISTA Project has a new name: The Transmission Project. For 9 years the Project has amplified the use of media and technology within more than 100 non-profit organizations and through 300 members volunteering across the country. While diverse in their missions, the Project&amp;#8217;s partners all have one thing in common: their use of media and technology to challenge social and economic inequality in&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new name, the Transmission Project more strongly emphasizes building capacity for equitable and effective use of public media and technology. To facilitate this, a newly created Digital Arts Service Corps recruits AmeriCorps*VISTA members to further develop our nation&amp;#8217;s public media and technology infrastructure. These full-time volunteers are serving with community radio stations, media arts and technology centers, rural broadband internet initiatives and others seeking to empower their community through the use of media and&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating a Digital Arts Service Corps, the talents and organizing skills of committed volunteers can be harnessed to connect people across online communities and amplify Americaâ€™s independent media voices and visions. Community-driven teams will design tools, social networks and online environments that bolster and stimulate community-building and participation. They will work with information technology specialists and independent media makers to democratize the next generation of broadband and information&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Digital Arts Service Corps marks a new strategic collaboration with the National Alliance for Media Arts &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Culture (NAMAC). Together, the Transmission Project and NAMAC hope to advance a movement that integrates national service, public digital infrastructure construction, capacity building for nonprofits and innovative uses of the technological arts in public and community-based&amp;nbsp;organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housed at the College of Public and Community Service at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, the Transmission Project and its new initiative, the Digital Arts Service Corps, is a grantee of the Corporation for National and Community&amp;nbsp;Service.&lt;/p&gt;
