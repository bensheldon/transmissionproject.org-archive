<p>Corps member Katie Ingersoll at Prometheus Radio Project is surveying LPFM stations throughout the nation to collect information about their unique programming, how they manage their station, and their finances.  The data will be added to the <a href="http://communitymediadatabase.org/">Community Media Database</a> project to act as a resource to stations and future LPFM applicants, allowing them to locate and contact other stations, and see information about how other stations&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>Katie made the survey and will be heading up outreach to stations to drive&nbsp;participation.</p>

                    <p>The VISTA conducted research into best practices, implemented the findings, and prepared monthly reports of social media participation data (twitter followers, facebook fans, myspace friends, etc). As a result, the VISTA has significantly expanded our social media outreach on MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. The VISTA also worked with our food pantry manager to develop a blog to raise awareness, funding and food for the food pantry – see ffon.tumblr.com for the result. The VISTA conducted a social media use study of other nonprofits in St Bernard Parish, Louisiana, and a preliminary study of social media use by nonprofits in the greater New Orleans area that are doing the same type of work as the Community Center (long-term disaster recovery) has also been completed. Data from these 2 studies is currently being analyzed and the findings will be used by our next VISTA to further develop the social media strategy used by the Community&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>The VISTA prepared 2 short videos which the Development Director integrated into the end of the year fundraising campaign (both available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ccstb" title="www.youtube.com/ccstb">www.youtube.com/ccstb</a>), including the “Thank You” video which was the cornerstone of this campaign. The VISTA produced a 5 minute overview of the Community Center and a volunteer testimonial (all available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ccstb" title="www.youtube.com/ccstb">www.youtube.com/ccstb</a>). The VISTA also compiled a CD that contains a comprehensive introduction to the Community Center of St Bernard. The CD includes video footage of hurricane Katrina damage to St Bernard and surrounding parishes, used by permission of levees.org, along with statements from the Community Center&#8217;s Executive Director, and a 12 minute video shot entirely by the VISTA that has interviews with key Community Center staff and details both the services available at the Community Center as well as ongoing needs. This CD is distributed to Community Center donors who give more than $25 as well as offered for sale for $10 to the more than 1,100 volunteers from all around the world who come to the Community Center annually. The 12 minute video will also be a key component in the various fundraising tours that the Executive Director is planning for coming&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Activity 3, the online giving catalog, proved the most challenging of all the tasks undertaken by the VISTA. Deciding on items to include and whether to structure the catalog as a retail sale (eg buy t-shirt with the Community Center logo and part of the sale price goes to the Community Center) vs a sponsorship sale (buy a hot meal for 40 people for $10 or 200 lbs of rice for the food pantry for $50) was the first challenge. In the end, after a review of what other non-profits are using, a sponsorship sale based on that used by Heifer International and the World Wildlife Federation was chosen. The next step was coding this catalog, including setting up a shopping cart that automatically generates the ability to choose from a variety of &#8220;thank you&#8221; e-cards for the purchaser after the sale is complete. We are very grateful to the VISTA for his dedication to the project and his willingness to develop his technical skills which enabled him to finish this complex&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>With the help of our first-year DASC member, we have expanded collaborations with other community media centers in the state and region, sharing technology, marketing, educational content and curriculum to media centers and non-profit organizations.<br />
-Increased communication with between two media centers to enable collaboration on several key projects including growing capacity of both organizations to fundraise, use technology tools, and manage staff and members.<br />
-Increased communication enabling the implementation of new technology resources, including access to other center&#8217;s technical staff, new equipment for CMAP&#8217;s institutional network and engineering expertise from other centers.<br />
-Increased CMAP&#8217;s ability to fundraise/build community awareness<br />
-Helped to initiate new strategies to develop and share community content between&nbsp;centers.</p>
<p>Based on the success of the first year of this project, we are now in the second year, expanding to a statewide collaboration. For the first year, both organizations expanded our capacity through seeing the need to hire staff for fundraising, collaborated on grants that resulted in funding and staffing, and created an expanded collaboration program into our region. After the second year, we hope that agencies will work together regularly to continue this&nbsp;collaboration.</p>
<p>Our VISTA accomplished all of what was included in our project, but also helped to write grants for the organizations and learned development skills. He was hired by one of the media centers after the project to be a development assistant. He also became involved in developing the second year plan for our expanded&nbsp;collaboration.</p>

                    <p>The AmeriCorps*VISTA project we are proposing is a critical component of our community technology program to promote broadband deployment and adoption in the low income neighborhoods we serve. We seek to build the capacity of our wireless and wired networks that will be installed in our affordable housing projects through the development of a program that will distribute community-based resources (equipment, trainings, information), establish resident advisory committees, and deploy wireless&nbsp;networks.</p>
<p>Our AmeriCorps*VISTA member will support our initiative through community outreach, surveys, and technical support. Specifically, s/he&nbsp;will:</p>
<p>- Develop and implement community-based outreach strategies for community wireless adoption and participation.<br />
- Collaborate with other project partners to develop outreach plans to expand our presence in the targeted communities.<br />
- Develop educational resources for community technology staff and residents in the targeted communities.<br />
- Coordinate and build the capacity of a community advisory committees in the targeted communities<br />
- Organize, coordinate, and develop community education workshops delivered by volunteers on community wireless networks<br />
- Develop sustainability models for the deployment of community wireless networks<br />
- Coordinate volunteer efforts to plan and deploy neighborhood wireless networks<br />
- Meet with technology center managers to coordinate community workshop activities<br />
- Work with project partners to build the technology skills capacity of youth in South Los Angeles<br />
- Develop a volunteer base of technology and community activists to support the deployment and sustainability of community wireless&nbsp;networks</p>
<p>Goal 1: Promote and increase the adoption of broadband within low-income communities<br />
Goal 2: Build the capacity of deployed community Wi-Fi networks through community&nbsp;participation.</p>

                    <p>The VISTA member has been instrumental in increasing the overall capacity of the Community Technology department. We now have documented standards and procedures for deploying residential and community Wi-Fi networks, as well as a track record and experience that can be used to provide technical assistance to other groups seeking to deploy similar Wi-Fi networks. We have compiled not only the technical procedures for wireless deployment but also a best practices guide, as we have learned from the challenges we&#8217;ve faced. The VISTA also helped to develop criteria and a process for selecting future contractors for our new networks. To ensure the sustainability of our networks we need to continue working with LTSC&#8217;s real estate and property management departments to develop a system for ongoing support and maintenance of the&nbsp;networks.</p>
<p>The VISTA member also assisted with grant writing, reporting and research to support and build the capacity of the Community Technology department. She also helped with program and curriculum development for the DISKovery Center&#8217;s digital media classes covering basic computer and internet skills to more advanced digital video editing and production. She also established a public access WiFi network at LTSC&#8217;s DISKovery Computer Center in Little Tokyo. The VISTA&#8217;s accomplishments in these areas seemed a natural addendum to the stated goals. She has proven herself to be highly competent in many areas and has therefore been given additional projects and responsibilities, as time and her own interests allowed. Since she is extremely self-motivated and is capable of accomplishing projects thoroughly and quickly, we were able to involve her in additional projects beyond what was&nbsp;proposed.</p>
<p>- Development of community and residential wi-fi resource materials made available online.<br />
- Development and dissemination of publicity and outreach materials to promote the Little Tokyo community through flyers, a community blog developed by and for community wireless users, print materials and a community wi-fi website.<br />
- Establishment of a community wireless blog to document the challenges and successes in deploying community wireless networks.<br />
- Deployment of three new free community Wi-Fi networks in LTSC&#8217;s affordable housing communities. Accomplishments toward achieving stated goals:<br />
- Curriculum developed for wifi trainings in the form of a wiki. The wiki was developed with some server assistance from Wataru Ebihara, LTSC&#8217;s Network Administrator.<br />
- Resource materials developed for wifi users / volunteers / nonprofits wishing to start wifi networks, also on the wiki.<br />
- Flyers for outreach developed with Spanish translation help from Sugey Salazar, computer instructor.<br />
- Community blog developed using a free blogger account. The VISTA has worked to transition administration of the blog to the LT community council for its ongoing sustainability.<br />
- Computer Adoption Program (CAP) program planned and organized, and additional wifi curriculum developed for the class<br />
- 10 families served.<br />
- Wifi deployed in the Reno Apartments using open source mesh routers from Open Mesh and broadband over power (BPL) technology to deploy a robust network at Reno. Switched Angelina Apartments to open source Open Mesh to enable better usage tracking.<br />
- Usage tracking of Wi-Fi networks<br />
- using free and open source tracking called CoovaOM, developed tracking methods and documentation for residential Wi-Fi networks.<br />
- Developed a Request for Proposals for the development of 5 new broadband networks in affordable housing projects; developed criteria for selecting a proposal and oversaw selection of contractor for these new&nbsp;networks.</p>

                    <p>The CTC Vista volunteer will increase our capacity by providing the technical assistance to develop a new media training program, systems for volunteers to use an interactive website, and develop volunteers to become trainers themselves for future participants. The VISTA’s role is to help us through this transition and move KNON into a position where we can provide existing services in newer, more relevant forms. Once the project is completed, the additional volunteers, trainers, training tools, online protocols, online audience, and online tools will augment our community connections by making sure the station is as interactive as possible and acts as a community resource that uses the latest technology to give its listenership a voice in the community and the ability to affect positive change in their own&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>The CTC Vista will be responsible for:<br />
Work with volunteers to mae presentations to organizations serving lower-income and minority communities in DFW<br />
Work with community members to conduct surveys to determine community media needs<br />
Develop curriculum to train to community organizations and their members to utilize media tools including blogs, audio recording and editing, video recording and editing, and social networking.<br />
Train volunteers to train additional community members to utilize media tools.<br />
Work with volunteers to develop a community media campaign around one identified issue that will be used as a template for future issue campaigns<br />
Develop protocols for volunteers to maintain the equipment and website for volunteer media&nbsp;work</p>

                    <p>The AmeriCorps*Vista will lead a commissioned survey of 150 CTCs in San Diego and take an active role in the centralization of the SDCTC as the regional organization for community technology in San Diego. The AmeriCorps*Vista also will revise and expand current bi-quarterly evaluation methods. The AmeriCorps*Vista will use the CTC survey data results to develop more opportunities for programming and resources sharing among San Diego area CTCs. The AmeriCorps*Vista&#8217;s crucial role will also be that of helping to faciliate more workshops and trainings focused on curriculum and resource sharing in collaboration with organizations and agencies involoved with community technology. The outcome will produce tranings and events that network San Diego area community technology centers, thus allowing more program development directed towards CTC staff and&nbsp;end-users.</p>

                    <p>Rodrigo has done an outstanding job with providing statistical data in our FLOCs. He provided demographics by charting the number of children, racial breakdown, income levels, languages spoken, and interest in all OTS&#8217; core program&nbsp;areas.</p>
<p>Our AmeriCorp*VISTA at OTS has conducted Art workshops in low-income apartment communities for disadvanted youth. If our Americorp*VISTA did not think beyond his workplan, these youth would not have been exposed to art in such a way that opened their minds. As a result the youth who have developed an appreciation for art. Our AmeriCorp*VISTA was also able to learn from our youth that everyone comes from various education and socio economic levels but we can work&nbsp;together.</p>
