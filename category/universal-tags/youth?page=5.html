                    <p>Ray was responsible for managing our computer refurbishing lab, including creating a training program for refurbishing volunteers, researching an inventory system, developing and leading technology workshops for our students. While his work in the refurb lab was very valuable, his most significant accomplishment, and the one that was the biggest benefit to our organization, was the workshops he developed for our technology&nbsp;center.</p>

                    <p>Ray spent the year coming up with ideas for the workshops, creating the materials necessary to lead the workshops, and organizing the instructors of the workshops. Workshop topics included digital storytelling, silent movie-making, audio dubbing, and 3D imaging.  Ray learned how create (and advertise) workshops that are appealing to teens and eventually had regular attendance at them.   Students in our program earn a free computer system to take home. Our policy states that if they attend 5 workshops, they&#8217;ll earn enough extra credit to earn a year of free internet access at home. While nearly all of our students earn the home computer, many students weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of the free internet since they weren&#8217;t getting the opportunity to attend workshops. With Ray&#8217;s help, a great number of students were able to attend the workshops that are required in order to earn home internet. While having a home computer is valuable to our students, without internet they remain at a disadvantage when it comes to completing homework and projects for&nbsp;school. </p>
<p>Now that Ray&#8217;s term has ended we are happy to have a whole library of workshop ideas and materials at the ready. Because everything has already been developed, it is much easier for us to recruit volunteers to lead our workshops, since it no longer requires a significant time commitment on their part. We are pleased that we were able to, and will be able to continue to, offer so many workshops to our students and that they may earn internet access at&nbsp;home.</p>

                    <p>Richard was a crucial part of the Mollie youth video team, providing youth access and exposure to digital video technology during Mollie moviemaking video projects with schools and community groups. Richard was especially instrumental in the use of digital audio technology, integrating audio technology into the Mollie youth projects and other GRCMC&nbsp;departments.</p>

                    <p>Richard assisted the education department with youth outreach curriculum development efforts, developing innovative ways to expose community youth to digital audio and video technology. He developed interest surveys for school and community info. gathering and assisted with the implementation of an open house for CMC Wealthy neighborhood residents. Richard was a member of the SMART Festival planning team, an international student media arts festival organized and hosted by&nbsp;GRCMC..</p>
<p>A particular story that stands out is the use of audio resources and curriculum developed by Richard: There was a young man named Patrick who was 14 years of age and lived across the street from Media Center with his Mom and 6 brothers and sisters. He would drop by the media center often after school. He learned a variety of video production skills and produced a few short studio productions for air on community television, but nothing seemed to really stick with him.  One day we asked him to produce and record a rap that could be used for promotion of the Mollie youth program. You could see the excitement in his eyes at that suggestion. In a matter of weeks he had the rap written out and beats to use with it created on the computer.  Using the tools and resources Richard had collected and organized, we were able to both find a passion for this young man and help promote our programs and&nbsp;organization.</p>

<p>Due to circumstances outside of Antonio’s control  (staff reduction at San Martin), Antonio had no supervision. It was decided that Antonio would try to work in the computer center at the new MAAC charter school. It turned out to be a good match. We feel that both Antonio and the Charter School have benefited from this new&nbsp;arrangement.</p>

                    <p>Pete has worked extensively with our Learn and Earn Program.  Over the past year and a half he has taught 12 classes and distributed over 100 re-deployed computers to underserved youth in the east end of Houston.  Pete has also developed a new Learn and Earn Program with graduating seniors at Milby, Chavez and Austin High School.  He will be starting our third class this summer.  Through these two programs he has been able to increase our overall volunteer hours.  This program is well received by the community and a welcome addition to the total program TFA&nbsp;offers. </p>
<p>Pete has managed our computer re-distribution program and completely overhauled the system.  All reporting is now done on-line and in real time.  He has also involved his student volunteers and our University of Houston Interns in the process.  The most unique feature to the re-distribution program is the way Pete transfers knowledge to the recipients.  The organization receiving the computers actually works with Pete and the volunteers in preparing their own equipment for their community technology center.  In this way they have enough basic knowledge to keep their equipment up and running.  To date Pete has re-distributed well over 300 computers and taught over 100 people in this&nbsp;program. </p>
<p>For the past two months Pete has put together an extensive summer youth program. (flyer available).  We should be able to reach over 50 unique community youth ranging in age from new 7th graders to graduating seniors.  The programs cover a variety of subjects. Pete has developed all the learning objectives for each course, developed a budget and schedule, and is in the process of recruiting students and volunteers.  One of his key program partners is NASA. They have offered to put a second session under Pete&#8217;s&nbsp;leadership.</p>

                    <p>Pete is a real friend to the youth of our community.  Through the Learn and Earn program Pete gets to know the youth, and then he takes it a step further.  Pete spends additional time with these kids and becomes much more than just a teacher, he also becomes their friend and mentor.  I believe Americorp Vista, through people like Pete, is making a real difference in the lives of these and other underserved youth.  This extra effort has also been a key component in the development of an extensive summer youth program. Pete has been able to use his relationship with these kids to customize a program that really has the kids&nbsp;exited.</p>

The first half of her term was spent generating community computer classes, developing more classes in each community, and training volunteers through Central Washington University (CWU) GEARUP.  The second half of the term was focused on expanding that interest to self-study and home use, and to continue the access to learning.  During the course of the year, over 130 users were involved in introductory computer classes and intermediate level classes.  Students logged roughly 1400 user hours.  Among other things, these classes built community capacity, strengthened a cadre of volunteers, and led BBCC to develop partnerships and open new computer classes in Mattawa, Royal City and Othello that were geared to second language&nbsp;learners.</p>

                    <p>Victoria refined and implemented a second language (Spanish) curriculum that was used in the computer classes.  She based the curriculum on research done with a variety of programs working with second language students.  CWU GEARUP linked with Victoria to provide work study students to teach computer classes in the three communities.  CWU recruited bilingual campus students who then taught the computer classes under the guidance of the VISTA program.   One of the CWU GEARUP program objectives is to increase knowledge and awareness of post secondary education for the families with children in these three communities.  Increasing the family’s access to technology is a link to their literacy growth and improves success in school.  Victoria also developed a strong relationship with the RECA Foundation in Kennewick and continued to link community members to the foundation so they could purchase refurbished computers at a low cost for their home use.  We have learned that real progress for most students is dependant on computers in the home.  Victoria was able to get computers into many of the student’s homes in Royal City and Mattawa and to help them keep these computers working.  The computers are geared more towards families and give kids a basis for learning.  They have security in place to prevent major problems from occurring to the operating system.  The major drawback in these computers is that they do not allow changes to the system and prevent use of the internet.  However, as a beginning computer for families, they are perfect because they aren’t susceptible to viruses as they become more comfortable with the computers, they can later invest in one that is Internet ready. In the meantime, Internet access and ESL software remains available in the community&nbsp;labs.</p>

                    <p>Victoria has been able to build upon the foundation that was established by last year’s VISTA member to continue the development of dynamic, active technology centers.  She is an enormous asset to both the organization and the communities in which she has demonstrated her talent and good&nbsp;will.</p>

                    <p>Ria has done a good job of connecting with schools and organizations to<br />
create alliances for projects and for recruitment. Ria hasalso  been wonderfully effective at recruiting guest speakers and field trip hosts for&nbsp;GGD.</p>
<p>Ria has done a wonderful job of preparing program information for the public, including the fall GGD update (sent to funders and partner agencies) and the December graduation flier. Because the program’s outreach has been so successful, there has not been a need for the extensive outreach we have had in the&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>I believe Ria’s work on program curriculum and her work in the classroom will be one of her greatest legacies in the program. She has developed strong curricula and has led successful, creative classes. She has developed curriculum for and taught the fall and spring classes and has developed a proposal for a summer video program. Her teaching style with the students has been steadily improving, and her comfort level and ability in working with students in and out of the classroom has been a pleasure to watch&nbsp;grow.</p>
