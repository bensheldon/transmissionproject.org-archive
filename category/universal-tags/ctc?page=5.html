                    <p>In addition to maintaining regular support to existing volunteers at the center, Mary met with existing partners to discuss potential additional programs:<br />
•	Project Farewell, University Presbyterian Church - G.E.D. program<br />
•	Inside/Outside Children’s Museum Art Program, Youth Web Design<br />
•	Arranged tax assistance dates with Tax Aides (formerly VITA) and Deloitte and Touche in February and early March; began advertising those dates in the community<br />
•	Family Literacy program, offered in partnership with REWA, two nights a week 4-6 participants per evening.<br />
•	Employment assistance offered by Neighborhood House employment specialists two afternoons a week.<br />
•	Intermediate ESL program, offered in partnership with the Seattle Literacy Council, two nights a week. Many participants are working with the goal of entering the G.E.D. class we are hoping to offer in early April.<br />
•	Talked with Student Nursing program to about creating a health related resource on RVLT website.<br />
•	Discussed RV Peace Pole project with Keesha Morris – explored funding opportunities for the project<br />
•	Researched available job resources for teens in preparation for a preliminary conversation on creating a youth employment services program at RV. Scheduled initial meeting for early March with Jobs Plus, RVLT, Boys and Girls Club, Youth Tutoring program, and Neighborhood&nbsp;House. </p>
<p>Held 2 tax nights with volunteers from Deloitte and Touche and 2 tax Saturdays with a volunteer from Tax Aide. All efforts were very successful! – 35 income tax returns were prepared for Rainier Vista residents. One additional tax day will be held on March&nbsp;1. </p>
<p>Job Referral program and ESL courses continued in February. Both programs saw “slow and steady” upwards acceptance and attendance levels from the community. The ESL course expanded beyond its initial limit of 7 students, so a second teacher from the Seattle Literacy Council comes in during the same time to teach the additional&nbsp;students. </p>
<p>Due to limited resources, the sustainability plan for the CTC is to partner with agencies providing services needed by residents through agreements to provide facilities in exchange for those services.  This is also meant to address resident concern about loss of funding for the employment program which included job search, job retention and wage progression&nbsp;activities.  </p>
<p>In addition to all of this, Mary is creating the volunteer manual, which will include information on:<br />
•	the basic care and maintenance of the computers<br />
•	center rules<br />
•	troubleshooting<br />
•	typical skills and help requested of&nbsp;volunteers</p>
<p>America Connects Consortium Data Collection Curriculum project:<br />
Mary has utilized her web and research expertise to identify and assess free online databases and tracking software for use in CTCs.  Also through her need to assess data requirements under a new service delivery plan, she has acted as a wonderful model for coordinator concerns about data collection requirements for&nbsp;sustainability.</p>
<p>Fundraising: researched Fremont Public Association AmeriCorps VISTA grant and submitted the segments of the grant which she was able to complete to RVLT for approval and decision making needed to complete the grant. Because of an overload of work due to the change in leadership, RVLT decided this was not a priority. Mary is continuing to research additional grants for software and lab&nbsp;funding.</p>

                    <p>Sharon has shown only the utmost dedication to the Cyber Y and has helped nurture our afterschool programming into a highly successful and sought after community afterschool option for our neighborhood. The first class was an overwhelming success with high retention and participation from our local 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders. This semester we added one day of programming and now offer Cyber Y afterschool for 3rd and 4th together and a separate class for the 5th&nbsp;graders. </p>
<p>In addition, Sharon has also worked closely with the Cyber Seniors class that meets once a week and provides ongoing instruction support and recruitment for the class. She also developed an open access time one morning a week in order to provide additional out of class time to participants to have more computer usage time. Starting with only a couple of attendees, word of mouth has quickly filled up this morning&nbsp;time.</p>

                    <p>C-CAN is a network of partner CTCs that was designed to provide resources and assistance to each other: Jeff’s job has been to organize these CTCs and provide start-up resources to seed the development of this collaborative.  The success of Jeff’s work has resulted in increased activity and the development of formal collaborations between partners, and Jeff will report on this activity in the coming&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Goal 1: Help local CTCs build capacity and increase usership through increased volunteer recruitment and better staff management of&nbsp;volunteers.</p>
<p>Goal 2:  Increase community participation at CTC networking activities and at&nbsp;workshops.</p>
<p>Goal 3: : Ensure that the work of the C-CAN will continue after the AmeriCorps*VISTA members&nbsp;leave.</p>

                    <p>Goal 1: The project has accomplished its major goals for 2002 already, in the recruitment of over 170 local volunteers for CTCs in our network and setting up CompuMentor volunteer management training for CTC&nbsp;staff.</p>
<p>Goal 2: Increased attendance at Quarterly meetings and annual conference from last years’ numbers, signed up 20+ attendees for CompuMentor&nbsp;training.</p>
<p>Goal 3: Working with members from local CTCs to encourage committee work and leadership within the&nbsp;C-CAN.</p>
<p>C-CAN’s AmeriCorps/ VISTA members have finished work on development of our main project: The Volunteer Hub.  This project required finalizing the database of local CTCs, contracting them to review their data, and training them in use of the online volunteer database and volunteer opportunities&nbsp;directory </p>
<p>Jeff Streier has concentrated on working with organizations to prepare them for using the Hub, Heidi Marshall has focused on recruitment of volunteers.  Both Members staffed a booth at the MN State Fair in late August of 2002 for 10&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>In addition to work on the volunteer management and recruitment projects, both Members helped to organize the second annual Twin Cities Community Technology Conference, which attracted over 75 participants. The Mayor of Minneapolis, R.T. Ryback, was on hand to deliver the keynote speech, and was so impressed by what the community is doing in terms of CTC activity that C-CAN was invited to a series of meetings at the Mayors’&nbsp;Office.</p>
<p>These meetings have resulted in the development of a new Community Technology Task Force, featuring participation by local government, industry, and non-profit technology providers. The focus of this task force is to develop a City agenda for improving “Digital Opportunity” for residents of the City of Minneapolis. Another outcome of this partnership is that C-CAN and the City of Minneapolis have just submitted a proposal for a cluster of 25 new AmeriCorps members to serve in local CTC&nbsp;projects.</p>

1) Better community service through better information and outreach:  VISTA workers will assist us with Community Mapping and community Outreach to determine modifications to services at existing CTC’s and the location of additional CTC’s<br />
2) Definition and documentation of the methods, the curriculum, and the effectiveness of the Byte Back model, the Technology Expert Organization (TEO), so that others may benefit from this success.<br />

                    <p>While actual canvassing of the local neighborhood was fruitful for relationships in our home neighborhood, networking with other organizations was more effective when we were exploring territory that was new to us.  We have provided assistance to many new organizations and this assistance ranges from extensive and on-going to brief and by&nbsp;request.  </p>
<p>VISTAs helped shape Byte Back’s future through the information gathered in community mapping and other outreach activities. Although we initially thought computer sales and fees for specific tasks might provide sustainability for Byte Back, our understanding the needs of the non-profit community changed through community mapping and attending or leading events and focus groups.  We found that many local non-profits had little idea how to meet their technical needs economically, and also needed assistance integrating program and technical planning. Often they relied on irregular volunteers or expensive consultants. Because of these needs revealed through our outreach programs, we have developed a Tech Gap Working Group which is redirecting our efforts towards the providing of planning and&nbsp;services.</p>

                    <p>Progress has been made in the attendance of children and adults in the CTC&#8217;s maintained for Ed West. At the end of August, we had a 20% increase of children arriving after school to do their homework or just surf on the net since February. We have also made an increase of adult attendance in the courses we held. We have had at least 100 certificates to give to the graduates from our beginner&#8217;s computer courses. Our adults have learned the basics of Microsoft Office and Windows. They have even learned how to search for jobs and build perfect resumes. We have given away at least 50 computers in the last six months to MA Rehab clients and also students that have taken our courses. Donations were made regular by major companies and by individuals who wanted to give to our community. I have also updated all 30 computers with new software that was used by all participants. Especially learning tools for the&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>Part of Paul’s job was the development of a lesson plan to teach residents the basics of computers.  Paul was to create a lesson plan for 6 or 8 week classes that would engage residents with a completion date set, and a new class to begin subsequently.  This did not happen as planned and the one class that has met is still meeting after 12 weeks, with the same four students and no set plan to end.  Paul is not supposed to be teaching directly, but it was allowed assuming that new volunteers were being sought to step in to teach.  With very little success in recruiting and maintaining volunteers Paul chose to teach classes directly, in an effort to get the computer center&nbsp;utilized.</p>
