                    <p>Elizabeth has assisted the education department in all of the stated areas, and has built a solid framework for a sustainable youth channel program. She launched the Youth Media Club, a new program which has attracted new youth to Media Bridges. She produced several videos with elementary school students as part of a 20-week outreach class at a local public school, which initiated an ongoing partnership with the school. She applied for a $1,000 grant to fund our summer camp program. She recruited two high school interns through a media internship program for minority high school students. She also established Media Bridges as a partner organization for a media career exploration program for high school students sponsored by an association of journalism professionals. She developed a youth policies and procedures handbook for Media Bridges, opening the door to more youth involvement in the future. She expanded the youth channel from a four hour block of programming per week, with an additional youth block timeslot for college student productions. She structured the youth page on the new web site, manages the content of the page providing information about the youth program to the public, and has also developed social networking outreach through Twitter, and avenues for video distribution through youtube, vimeo, ListenUp, and local youth filmmaking site&nbsp;IndieViz.</p>
<p>Establishing a youth leadership board was part of our original plan for the youth channel, but that was not completed. The initial lack of youth involved with the organization made that difficult and also unrealistic at this time. Elizabeth has been able to recruit youth participants, which will pave the way for a youth leadership board in the future. There has not been a full-scale volunteer management system put into place for the youth program. Although Elizabeth recruited volunteers and worked with staff to improve volunteer procedures, the Media Bridges volunteer management system is in the process of restructuring, so a youth volunteer management system was put on hold until a better structure is implemented by the operations department. In the meantime, Elizabeth has worked to create opportunities for youth volunteers and has streamlined youth volunteers into the overall volunteer&nbsp;process</p>
<p>Although it was not originally included in the project proposal, Elizabeth created, designed and maintained a youth section on the Media Bridges Web site, created social network outreach (Twitter, Youtube, Vimeo, Facebook) and established additional distribution methods for youth-produced videos online, through video-sharing sites. At the beginning of her service year, the Media Bridges Web site had no information regarding youth programs and was not being updated because we were in the middle of a redesign. When the new site went live, Elizabeth became active in overall site maintenance, specifically in creating the youth&nbsp;section</p>

                    <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>There are significantly more youth in the building, on a regular basis, than there have ever been in recent memory. New precedents, policies and procedures have been set that have made Media Bridges a more youth-friendly organization and have broken down barriers to youth participation. Elizabeth has also provided support for youth-oriented projects initiated by Media Bridges producers, volunteers, staff, and other nonprofits. We plan to absorb the new programs and activities into the current staff, continue initiated programs such as the youth media club, and continue using the youth policies developed.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>Julie&#8217;s work was instrumental in meeting our program goals of elevating more local residents to present media on the issues that affect their communities. We have countless blog posts, videos, photos and other pieces of issue-oriented media published on our website, and they have been seen by thousands of visitors in the course of the year. Julie&#8217;s execution of the Neighbormedia program also greatly successful in bringing our communities closer to each other. We saw many scenarios in which one citizen journalist published material about a community issue which then led to a high level of readership, discussion and participation around that particular issue. Bringing local producers together with their local audience is a massive tool for building&nbsp;community.</p>

                    <p>HandyCapable Network (HCN)was started as a project of Arc of North Carolina Housing Development Services.  The project started by establishing Computer Learning Centers (CLCs) for developmentally disabled adults.  Four years later, HCN and local partner agencies, have established 22 centers in central North Carolina that serve adults with a broad spectrum of&nbsp;disabilities.</p>
<p>In addition, HCN provides computers and technical support for nonprofits for their administrative computers. We work together with NetCorps who will help an organization plan their technology needs. HCN supplies and sets up computers and office&nbsp;networking.</p>
<p>The HCN Americorps/Vista volunteer will have these responsibilities that will build the capacity of HCN to support the centers it has established for partner agencies, and to provide refurbished computers to disenfranchised populations. A key focus will be activities to maintain an incoming flow of donated computers and distribution of refurbished computers to end users, as well as resource development to cover refurbishing&nbsp;costs.</p>
<p>Marketing<br />
1. Develop partnerships to receive donations of computers for refurbishing.<br />
2. Develop ways to distribute computers beyond the needs of new CLCs established by HCN.  For instance, building on current relationships with social service non-profits to put computers in homes of low-income families; explore computers for after school programs; provide computers for non-profit office use.<br />
3.Develop a marketing and public relations plan and implement the plan toward the goals of community awareness, gaining financial support and computer donations. Plan to include print, radio, tv media, and website and other online options.<br />
4. Develop or revise marketing materials to support both of these efforts including: 1) letters to potential computer donors; 2)  Project description/brochure; 3) Edit and distribute two newsletters for the program as a support to marketing and fundraising&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<p>Fundraising<br />
1. Develop a one hour &#8220;tour&#8221; program, and host visitors monthly.<br />
2. Develop corporate partnerships that include computer and/or financial donations.<br />
3. Further develop the supporter database to track donations, and to ease communications by letter and email with supporters.<br />
4. Develop an acknowledgment plan to thank donors and recognize donations.<br />
5. Coordinate one or two fundraising&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>Project Coordination Assistance<br />
1. Assist in managing the computer distribution for one or more major projects, including the distribution of computers to 7th grade students at Hairston Middle School in 2007-08.

                    <p>Anna took complete responsibility for the annual appeal letter in April, using the over 400 names entered into the new Exceed database which was completed by then. She was responsible for tracking the donations and sending out the thank you notes. Over $5,000 was raised for&nbsp;HCN.</p>
<p>She developed an ongoing partnership with Earth Fare, a local organic supermarket, where our first Community Recycling Event was held in the spring. It was covered by the a local TV channel and the newspaper. Over 75 computers and assorted equipment were received. She helped Nate, our new Vista, with the contacts and planning for our second one held Sept 6, 7th. This has helped raise community awareness of our organization and both events have resulted in ongoing equipment donations from local&nbsp;businesses.</p>
<p>Anna single-handedly made it possible for HCN to distribute 223 computers to low income 7th and 8th graders at Hairston Middle School and 20 more to teachers with no computer in their homes. Her desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to find the children who had no phone, deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, finding Spanish interpreters to communicate with the families of the children with minimal English. She co-ordinated the transportation and then the distribution of from 20-40 computers to the school on the 6 distribution dates. I can&#8217;t say enough how much that meant not only to the staff of HCN that were busy getting the computers ready but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna&#8217;s&nbsp;diligence.</p>
<p>There are many more instances where Anna&#8217;s service to HCN was above and beyond her duties, her desire to help others through HCN is a shining example of AmeriCorp Vista service. In fact she became so indispensable we have offered her a full time position. She has taken a 8-10 month sabbatical to help her father but plans on returning to&nbsp;us.</p>

                    <p>There were many areas of Zumix Radio and Zumix in general to which Diana contributed. She helped prepare youth for radio work, including going on the air and journalism. She helped prepare Zumix journalists for pieces that have been posted on our blog: zumixradio.blogspot.com. She helped develop underwriting material and other publicity material. She was a full participant in staff meetings and helped contribute to staff trainings and retreats. She assisted with Zumix events such as the Walk For Music. and with gathering information necessary for&nbsp;grantors.</p>
<p>Simply extrapolate from the above, as Diana was successful at all work undertaken. She became a valued member of the Zumix community, including learning how to play the bass and participating in Zumix&nbsp;recitals.</p>
<p>With regard to challenges faced, Diana initially had little radio experience and needed to acquire some quickly, which she&nbsp;did.</p>

                    <p>As a CTC HOME, Inc has been working with the Boston Public schools to develop community computer/media labs in several schools. The main thrust of the program has been based on a Media Literacy and Health project that was funded by the U.S. Department Education under which we have been developing media and technology curriculum in five&nbsp;schools.</p>
<p>This Summer we are projecting having 25 teens in a 30 hour per week six week, media intensive at the BNN studio in&nbsp;Roxbury</p>
<p>The media lab project has five areas of&nbsp;focus:</p>
<p>1) strengthening teens&#8217; confidence through projects after school in media arts, that include  self expression through media and computer&nbsp;techonologies. </p>
<p>2) providing professional development for teachers in project-based learning and media literacy  to help connect after school with in school&nbsp;learning, </p>
<p>3) providing workshops and projects after school that increase teens&#8217; critical thinking, communications and problem solving&nbsp;skills, </p>
<p>4) building an in-school and after school network of teachers, parents and mentors to support&nbsp;teens.</p>
<p>5) building a broad base of funding support for the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Currently HOME, Inc has two full time staff devoted to the&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>Each CTC ProjectCoordinator/VISTA will work with the administrators at each of the school and after school programs to help develop the in-school and after school network of teachers, parents and mentors that can provide support to the students utilizing the media&nbsp;lab.</p>

                    <p>Stephen was the primary link between HOME, Inc. and Brighton High School. providing technical support to four teachers and supporting teachers in two media classes by helping to develop curriculum, provide professional development support including support to the teachers as they learned new computer applications. Stephen provided additional help to some of the students and helped our Media Lab Coordinator organize his work and program at Social Justice Academy. Stephen updated our website and helped develop and update our summer Teen TV content management system for our six week long summer&nbsp;intensive.</p>
<p>Stephen is a dedicated, sensitive and creative teacher who in his low key style gains the trust of hardened and skeptical teachers and students at the schools. He has outstanding problem solving skills and accepts most difficulties with grace and a can do attitude. Stephen was able to provide a high degree of leadership during our summer Teen TV intensive, providing both technical and creative support that encouraged staff and students to excel. His work on our website has helped to ensure that the content management system will continue to be an important factor in our organization&#8217;s growth and&nbsp;success.</p>

The current plan is to divide their time on structured tangible work like making networking phone calls and unstructured work like figuring out how to get more of the public using our sites. The VISTA will attend meetings of groups of agencies, demo our software, develop ways to increase viewership, attend public events like festivals, make followup networking phone calls to agency representatives after meetings, and contact agency <span class="amp">&amp;</span> program contacts to get them to update or add entries to the&nbsp;database.</p>
<p>- Increase the number of organizations putting their records into our databases<br />
- Increase the number of people searching for information on our sites<br />
- Document a reproducible process for getting organizations to put their info on our&nbsp;sites.</p>

                    <p>Carolyn has brought in approximately $3,000 in undesignated donations, almost reaching her goal of $5000. Working with board members and other staff, Carolyn scheduled coffee or lunch meetings with past and potential supporters and asked them for money. Carolyn created a database of past and potential donors of more than 300 members. Carolyn also organized and ran a fundraising Tea that brought in approximately $1000. Considering our past best year for individual donations was about $700, this is quite a leap&nbsp;forward. </p>
<p>The Community Software lab now has the infrastructure for soliciting donations and for putting on fund-raising events. We also now have an organizational culture that values fundraising. To insure we can continue, our board and permanent staff have worked with Carolyn on fund-raising setup and implementation and pledged to continue when she leaves. Remaining work includes refining our presentation for different potential donors. We need to cultivate donors outside our existing&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>When Carolyn started we realized that her work should fit into a larger plan, a plan that we had not yet created. Carolyn has contributed to our business planning efforts and our draft/working business plan document. Carolyn has done planning work on an un-conference we are exploring putting on with another organization. Carolyn recruited somebody who is proving to be one of our better board members. Carolyn helped write two&nbsp;grants.</p>

                    <p>With the help of our first-year DASC member, we have expanded collaborations with other community media centers in the state and region, sharing technology, marketing, educational content and curriculum to media centers and non-profit organizations.<br />
-Increased communication with between two media centers to enable collaboration on several key projects including growing capacity of both organizations to fundraise, use technology tools, and manage staff and members.<br />
-Increased communication enabling the implementation of new technology resources, including access to other center&#8217;s technical staff, new equipment for CMAP&#8217;s institutional network and engineering expertise from other centers.<br />
-Increased CMAP&#8217;s ability to fundraise/build community awareness<br />
-Helped to initiate new strategies to develop and share community content between&nbsp;centers.</p>
<p>Based on the success of the first year of this project, we are now in the second year, expanding to a statewide collaboration. For the first year, both organizations expanded our capacity through seeing the need to hire staff for fundraising, collaborated on grants that resulted in funding and staffing, and created an expanded collaboration program into our region. After the second year, we hope that agencies will work together regularly to continue this&nbsp;collaboration.</p>
<p>Our VISTA accomplished all of what was included in our project, but also helped to write grants for the organizations and learned development skills. He was hired by one of the media centers after the project to be a development assistant. He also became involved in developing the second year plan for our expanded&nbsp;collaboration.</p>

                    <p>Since it opened over 8 years ago, the DISKovery Center has provided technology education services to over 3,000 community members in a wide range of skills and computer applications. Over 100 members, who include youth, adults, and seniors, enroll in over 20 classes at the DISKovery Centerâ€™s programs every&nbsp;quarter.</p>
<p>The DISKovery Center is seeking a full-time VISTA volunteer (monthly stipend provided) to help build the capacity of the Center to reach out to learners with physical and developmental disabilities through assistive technology, program planning, staff training, and community outreach. The VISTA member will assist the program manager with a variety of responsibilities, including the following&nbsp;duties:</p>
<p>â€¢	Develop strategies for outreach to persons with&nbsp;disabilities</p>
<p>â€¢	Collaborate with other organizations to develop outreach plans to expand our presence in the disabled&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>â€¢	Participate in assistive technology trainings provided by our collaborators to become an in-house accessibility specialist, who will then train other staff on teaching&nbsp;strategies</p>
<p>â€¢	Develop resources for accessibility including training materials for both staff and individuals with&nbsp;disabilities</p>
<p>â€¢	Help develop a new space plan at the center for better&nbsp;accessibility </p>
<p>â€¢	Help establish and coordinate a committee composed of staff, members and volunteers to inform the center on disability access&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>â€¢	Help develop a new intake survey and registration process incorporating disability information, and revamp the current database to track this&nbsp;information.</p>

                    <p>Our CTC VISTA is the DISKovery Centers Accessibility Coordinator. She coordinated all of the meetings with staff and project partners. She also became our in-house AT specialist, and helped recommend our software and hardware purchases. She has developed advanced curriculum at Pacific Bridge. She has also coordinated and facilitated the access committee meetings. Our VISTA has also coordinated our Computer Adoption Program and has developed curriculum for the program. She has also trained staff on the Ubuntu Operating system so that staff can then teach the participants enrolled in our Computer Adoption&nbsp;Program.</p>
<p>Although we have partnered with other organizations that have given us a small number of users with disabilities, we are still short of our goals. Our VISTA has assisted on our outreach plan, and has developed outreach materials but both our centers in Little Tokyo and Echo Park are struggling increase our&nbsp;numbers.</p>

                    <p>We would like to host a VISTA member who will develop effective social media communication that will support and complement A-VOYCEâ€™s existing communications and outreach structure. The VISTA member will primarily be responsible developing our use of social media tools such as, but not limited to, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, blogs, wikis, for publicity, marketing, and fundraising purposes. The VISTA will develop training material for youth and staff on blogging, podcasting, digital and social media. ACDC needs to capitalize on social networking media and build our organizational capacity through increased use of technology-enabled&nbsp;venues. </p>
<p>Goal: To create and implement a web-based marketing and outreach strategy for ACDC and A-VOYCE youth development program in order to maximize the program&#8217;s outreach and fundraising&nbsp;capacity</p>

                    <p>One of my main tasks is putting together our Annual Report. One of the more interesting elements of the report has been coordinating Chinese translations that accurately capture our programs; luckily there are staff members here who are able to help out with&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>The power of Facebook, Twitter, and many other forms of social media continue to fascinate me. We have some really innovative urban planning, human development, and youth-based programs which I think have great potential to be marketed using social media. It will be a good experiment to see just what is possible using these up and coming&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>I have been able to apply my IST monies towards an accounting class. While at first glace an accounting class may not seem relevant to my marketing and communications work, it has been beneficial as I am gaining a greater understanding of how my organization operates. Additionally, it has helped me draft the important financial sections of our annual report, and compile content for charity rating websites which closely examine non-profit&nbsp;finances.</p>

                    <p>The CTC Vista volunteer will increase our capacity by providing the technical assistance to develop a new media training program, systems for volunteers to use an interactive website, and develop volunteers to become trainers themselves for future participants. The VISTAâ€™s role is to help us through this transition and move KNON into a position where we can provide existing services in newer, more relevant forms. Once the project is completed, the additional volunteers, trainers, training tools, online protocols, online audience, and online tools will augment our community connections by making sure the station is as interactive as possible and acts as a community resource that uses the latest technology to give its listenership a voice in the community and the ability to affect positive change in their own&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>The CTC Vista will be responsible for:<br />
Work with volunteers to mae presentations to organizations serving lower-income and minority communities in DFW<br />
Work with community members to conduct surveys to determine community media needs<br />
Develop curriculum to train to community organizations and their members to utilize media tools including blogs, audio recording and editing, video recording and editing, and social networking.<br />
Train volunteers to train additional community members to utilize media tools.<br />
Work with volunteers to develop a community media campaign around one identified issue that will be used as a template for future issue campaigns<br />
Develop protocols for volunteers to maintain the equipment and website for volunteer media&nbsp;work</p>
