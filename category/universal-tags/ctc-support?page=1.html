                    <p>Amber Lanes is currently working as a computer technician with Lee County CDC/CTC. Amber has shown an interest in the technology program and is working to enhance the community outreach efforts pertaining to the use of technology in today&#8217;s&nbsp;society. </p>
<p>Amber adds her own personal touch to the community training for the various groups and individual training sessions held at the Technology Center. Her approach builds the comfort zone for each person, regardless of their skill levels. She also works very hard to resolve the various hardware problems both at the CTC and with other nonprofits in the&nbsp;community. </p>
<p>Lee County Community Technology Center has been the hub for technology training and uses since 1999. With Amber&#8217;s contributions the CTC remains at the forefront in filling the needs of the community. Amber continues to be a valued asset to Lee County CDC/CTC and to the&nbsp;community. </p>
<p>Our AmeriCorp Vista member is currently working with the on-line training program for the A-Plus Core Certification Examination through Prep&nbsp;Logic.</p>

                    <p>The technology program working in conjunction of the Arkansas Delta Dreams program provides individual and special group sessions.  Our successes for the past quarter have been the effective training of 15 seniors in basic and intermediate software and hardware. They covered the components of the computer, various basic software applications, surfing the Internet and sending and receiving e-mail.  This has prompted many of the participants, whose ages range from 65 to 85, to purchase computer for their homes and/or obtain Internet services so they can “keep up and stay in the know.”  One of the participants called our offices when they received their first e-mail communications from their great-great grand child, who is ten years of age. We call this bridging the generation and technology&nbsp;gaps.</p>

<p>• Posted rules and calendar of lab hours. Cat has developed a calendar to post for lab hours. She has also met with the volunteer monitors to establish rules for the lab. She is currently working with the monitors to ensure the rules are being&nbsp;followed.</p>

The FLOCs began with limited resources, equipment, and program structure. We are glad that Mike has assisted the Community Development Division in growing its resources, researching viable technology funding options, and establishing a line of communication among staff through the message board. Mike displays a high level of enthusiasm for growing the resources and establishing partnerships for SDCTC. He has made sure that both OTS and SDCTC stay abreast on technological trends, resources, policies, and&nbsp;innovations.</p>

                    <p>Sue has helped us launch our project nationally, and we know have over 350 affordable and public housing facilities using “Abilities for Resident Service Coordinators” to link low income frail elderly and disabled residents to community services.  “Abilities for Resident Service Coordinators” has been endorsed by the American Association of Service Coordinators and is acknowledged by industry professionals as a vital tool in keeping elderly residents in independent living.  With the infusion of technology in elderly and disabled resident service coordination, properties are able to keep residents independent, and avoid unnecessary and costly institutionalization.  This project is a prime example of using community technology to meet pressing needs, and impact important policy&nbsp;areas. </p>
<p>Sue helped us attend a national conference in San Antonio, Texas, in which we brought 20 laptops and set up a training lab.  We taught Resident Service Coordinators how to use technology to link their residents to community services, manage their residmonitor resident and program outcomes with&nbsp;technology. </p>
<p>Sue has been a vital player in helping us develop an implementation plan for CTCs in affordable housing communities in Southern California, as she is at our office early every day to assist with implementation.  Her involvement helped us determine that we could expand beyond 50 to now over 200&nbsp;CTCs. </p>
<p>Sue led the effort at Pangea Foundation to develop the training manual for our users.  She has helped develop the 100+ page training manual that is available to users when they log into the system.  This is an ongoing effort.  She also helps with phone training, and attended our training conference in San Antonio,&nbsp;Texas.</p>
<p>Sue has helped run the show at Pangea with the Resident Service Coordinators.  She is the first to receive their calls when they need technical help.  She continuously tests the systems.  She helped create the training manuals and system forms for printed materials.  Sue’s involvement as an AmeriCorp*VISTA member enables our organization to provide these services to the community. To date, this system has over 200 properties using it, which represents service delivered and managed to 20,000 low income elderly and disabled residents across the&nbsp;country.</p>

                    <p>The mission of e-Equality, Inc. is to develop and promote initiatives and programs which bridge the digital divide and reduce the technological inequities experienced by low-income and disadvantaged citizens and small business in economically distressed neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County.  By working hand-in-hand with our current Americorps*VISTA member(s), e-Equality has made significant strides toward the fulfillment of addressing the evident digital divide in South Florida.  By assisting in the development and evolution of the Technology Access Coalition (TAC) and conducting a needs assessment of existing CTCs in Miami-Dade County as well as researching and evaluating CTC training materials, Americorps*VISTA member Chaneqa Wooten has been exposed to a variety of research&nbsp;practices.</p>
<p>Working with TAC, a target list of CTCs has been established for the initial needs assessment survey.  A finalized version of this survey has also been completed.  The targeted list of CTCs will be broken up amongst TAC members and survey results will be compiled in an Excel or Access database by Ms. Wooten.  Following the completion of such said deliverables, Ms. Wooten [will] work with e-Equality’s web-development team toward the integration of this data into the CTCNet and TAC websites in addition to all other set-out&nbsp;goals.</p>

By compiling a comprehensive listing of organizations and companies which offer free software and services for non-profit organizations, preliminary expectations were surpassed.  Although nearly 50% complete with this research, the accumulated data has already proved to be beneficial to the Technology Access&nbsp;Coalition.</p>
