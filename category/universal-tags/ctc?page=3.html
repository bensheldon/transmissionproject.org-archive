                    <p>The Americorps VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and piloting a technology class for our English speaking clients, the majority of whom are African-American. The goal is to motivate women from the HPP&#8217;s English speaking support groups to avail themselves of the resources in the computer lab.  To reinforce and extend the class experience, the Americorps*VISTA will create a weblog specifically for these clients where they can share their interests, issues, questions and accomplishments. The weblog community will serve as an additional support group to these parents as they seek ways out of poverty. Through participation in classes, one-on-one instruction, and the weblog, these clients will upgrade their job and communication&nbsp;skills.</p>
<p>Our 2004-2005 VISTA developed a community web-site for homeless families and families in jeopardy of becoming homeless.  This website is fast becoming a vital resource to such families and to case managers throughout the region for instant access to resource information.    This years Americorps VISTA would expand the use of the website by (1) developing a workshop to introduce the website to new users, both clients and case managers,  (2) develop promotional materials such as email announcements and posters, and (3) work with other volunteers to develop a separate homepage, navigation system and additional features just for case&nbsp;managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and coordinating a staff development program in the CTC. Since one of the best practices for strengthening a program such as ours is to invest in our case workers, we are planning to use the CTC for more staff development than in previous years.  We will develop an on-line assessment tool to establish a baseline of the technology skills of all staff members. Using this data we will develop and coordinate skill set workshops tailored to staff needs that will be held in the&nbsp;CTC.  </p>
<p>To strengthen and  expand our job readiness program the Americorps*VISTA will be responsible for developing 5  In order to do this the VISTA will identify, contact and visit appropriate educational and vocational training programs.  In addition the VISTA will develop referral protocols between these programs and HPP Case&nbsp;Managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer will also coordinate our &#8220;Computers in the Home&#8221; Project. This project takes our capacity to give technological skills and experience to the underserved population beyond the walls of our CTC. Funded to provide 40 families with refurbished computers and in-home tech support through ReliaTech, a social venture project of StreetTech of Richmond, CA., participants receive training and, upon completion of the training, computers and periodic in-home tech support. In addition, clients who have received computers for their homes continue to receive training at the HPP&#8217;s&nbsp;CTC. </p>
<p>Finally, the Americorps*VISTA will collaborate with our partners in the Community Connectivity Collaboration (One Economy, StreetTech, ReliaTech, Canal Alliance, TechFutures), a group formed to define needs of local CTC&#8217;s and find ways to seek funding. The VISTA will attend CCC meetings and other partnering events that may&nbsp;develop.</p>

                    <p>I know that I speak for the entire staff of the Homeless Prenatal Program (HPP) when I say that Ellen-Rae Cachola has been a boon to our organization. As her supervisor in the Community Technology Center it has been my pleasure to work very closely with her for the last 12 months. She is highly committed, intelligent, and industrious. She is extremely productive and always looking for new projects. She is also very personable, able to interact warmly with the diverse groups of people who work in our program and who come here for services. We are very lucky that she has stayed on at HPP as a part-time employee while she attends graduate school in San&nbsp;Francisco.  </p>
<p>Ellen&#8217;s duties at HPP have included maintaining two websites, teaching technology in English and in Spanish, maintaining and developing the client database on Microsft Access, as well as trouble shooting technology problems in the lab and at staff workstations. She has worked with the local cable television access station to create PSAs and informational programming. In addition she has created an online generator for our paper forms which allows staff to print forms on an as needed basis from their own computers. She has also designed and published agency literature and signage in english and in&nbsp;spanish.</p>

                    <p>The AmeriCorps*Vista will lead a commissioned survey of 150 CTCs in San Diego and take an active role in the centralization of the SDCTC as the regional organization for community technology in San Diego. The AmeriCorps*Vista also will revise and expand current bi-quarterly evaluation methods. The AmeriCorps*Vista will use the CTC survey data results to develop more opportunities for programming and resources sharing among San Diego area CTCs. The AmeriCorps*Vista&#8217;s crucial role will also be that of helping to faciliate more workshops and trainings focused on curriculum and resource sharing in collaboration with organizations and agencies involoved with community technology. The outcome will produce tranings and events that network San Diego area community technology centers, thus allowing more program development directed towards CTC staff and&nbsp;end-users.</p>

<p>Our AmeriCorp*VISTA at OTS has conducted Art workshops in low-income apartment communities for disadvanted youth. If our Americorp*VISTA did not think beyond his workplan, these youth would not have been exposed to art in such a way that opened their minds. As a result the youth who have developed an appreciation for art. Our AmeriCorp*VISTA was also able to learn from our youth that everyone comes from various education and socio economic levels but we can work&nbsp;together.</p>

                    <p>Andrea has excelled. She has done a wonderful job coordinating our volunteer resources for our CTCs, ensuring our centers are well staffed and open to the public.  She has improved our technical capacity by creating a shared calendar in outlook which enables the organization staff to access CTC hours and volunteer information. In order to better support and recognize our volunteers, Andrea has implemented a monthly newsletter that goes out to the public and also volunteer appreciation week in April.  In collaboration with the volunteer coordinator Andrea developed a recruitment plan for youth, LEP adults and seniors, which has greatly increased the number of volunteers at our sites and exceeded our recruiting&nbsp;goals.</p>

                    <p>Our two VISTA members have been instrumental in developing our community technology at the CCNV Homeless shelter.

                    <p>Our VISTAs have helped establish the technology center and develop resources for technology access and training programs for the shelter population, as well as other disadvantaged populations utilizing it. They have also laid the groundwork for building a self-sustaining service-learning model where trained members of the homeless community gain work-based learning experiences by performing vital technology repair and training services for local non-profit organizations and government agencies. Because of their work, the program has become famous,. The shelter now has quality computers, internet access and many of the 1300 residents are now getting their own computers. This success has been facilitated by the work of Tony and Larry, who have developed marketing and outreach materials, organized events and developed our list of partners and supporting organizations in the community. They have built the capacity of our organization by helping upgrade our constituent database so that we can better track donors and individuals. In regard to our programs, they have helped develop our curriculum and improve our process for refurbishing and distributing computers to program participants at the homeless&nbsp;shelter.</p>

                    <p>When James first joined Boat People S.O.S. (BPSOS) as an AmeriCorps*VISTA Member he was assigned multiple tasks as set forth in his AmeriCorps*VISTA Member Assignment Description.  He was able to successfully complete the objectives of Goal 1 for Quarter 1.  However, he was not able to complete Objective 2a, to implement an ESL class at the House for Senior Citizens at the Lockwood/Elmwood in Arlington, Virginia for two reasons.  First, the occupants did not feel the ESL class was necessary (they were only interested in learning about the Internet and computers).  Second, James was not able to recruit a volunteer to teach the class.  He did successfully complete Objectives 2b and&nbsp;2c.</p>
<p>For Quarter 3, James assisted a BPSOS staff in setting up new program for Victims of Trafficking.  He worked on this program for approximately one month and then he assisted another staff member with the Tax Assistance for Vietnamese Immigrants with Low Income (TAVILLI) program.  From January 1 through April 23, he organized tax preparation sessions 3 days a week, 2 hours each session.  He recruited volunteers and established a database containing names of volunteers that may help with future tax clinics.  He went out in the Vietnamese community and distributed 800 flyers advertising free tax preparation.  He enrolled 300 individuals for tax preparation, and kept a database of those individuals. When he enrolled the individuals for tax preparation, he gave out a needs assessment/opinion survey for them to complete. This survey informed individuals about programs available at BPSOS (computer, ESL and&nbsp;etc…).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was unable to complete the objectives as stated in Quarter 4 before the end of his one-year service because the first issue of BPSOS Mach Song was not published until July 2002.  However, he did update BPSOS newsletter database.   This database contains names of past and current BPSOS clients as well as others who want to receive the newsletter in the mail.   Articles written in the newsletter highlight human-interest stories as well as provide information of services available to&nbsp;individuals.</p>

                    <p>• Completed a CTC lab inventory<br />
• Set-up user registration database and survey form<br />
• Established a set of rules and regulations for the users<br />
• Set up regular computer classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the months of July<br />
• Basic computer classes were taught with adults.<br />
• Oversaw the operations of the CTC<br />
• Working with volunteers to instruct basic classes<br />
• Set up policies and procedures for new computer&nbsp;center</p>
<p>Due to circumstances outside of Antonio’s control  (staff reduction at San Martin), Antonio had no supervision. It was decided that Antonio would try to work in the computer center at the new MAAC charter school. It turned out to be a good match. We feel that both Antonio and the Charter School have benefited from this new&nbsp;arrangement.</p>

                    <p>Project&nbsp;Goals</p>
<p>•	Increase the sustainability of the Café through the development of a systematic volunteer recruitment approach and support mechanisms (orientation, job descriptions, training, reward system, etc.), so that it will continue to grow and thrive as a key resource for low-income persons to develop skills and gain access to&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>•	Public and private sector resources will enable the project to continue after the VISTA member leaves.  MATV/CTAC currently maintains a number of relationships with community agencies, volunteers, and businesses.  MATV/CTAC will maintain any new relationships the VISTA member develops that support the long-term success of this project.  This will include coordinating the VISTA member’s activities in relation to these groups’ programs and participation in the&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>Neil has developed and is now using a volunteer orientation <span class="amp">&amp;</span> training guide. He has also recruited 15 new volunteers for facility coverage, mentoring, and instruction. Neil worked with 2 volunteers to work on an internal member database and developed a system for volunteer scheduling and&nbsp;retention.</p>
<p>Neil identified low-cost, effective volunteer rewards. Neil awarded gift certificates to some volunteers and incorporated Cyber Café volunteers into MATV volunteer appreciation&nbsp;party.</p>
<p>Neil also taught basic courses in order to assure coverage. He installed a database and instituted its&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Neil has also worked with CATC members and MATV staff <span class="amp">&amp;</span> volunteers to achieve his second&nbsp;goal.</p>
