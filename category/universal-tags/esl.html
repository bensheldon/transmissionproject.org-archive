                    <p>Volunteer&nbsp;Recruitment</p>
<p>Direct Service to PACER&nbsp;Center</p>
<p>A special request came from the PACER center, the Parent Center that works with families of children and young adults from birth to age 22 with a full range of disabilities: physical, mental, learning, emotional, and attention deficit disorders. Carley was asked to provide ten hours, one-to-one support to David, an adult participant of the Pacer Center. Due to the nature of the request and David&#8217;s availability, Carley couldn’t link him with a volunteer, so she provided the service herself. Carley assessed David’s computer skills to develop a curriculum that would help him to obtain the basic knowledge he needed to obtain&nbsp;employment.</p>
<p>Accelerated Reader&nbsp;Software</p>
<p>Late 2003, Pillsbury United Communities acquired Accelerated Reader software to help students increase their reading skills. About 95% of the youths that attend Pillsbury Center programs have been assessed with reading skills below their academic grade. In most cases students are two grades&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>Waite House English as Second Language&nbsp;Classes</p>
<p>Our English teacher, John, got the support of Carley to develop an English/ Computer curriculum for our ESL learners.  From January of 2004 year up to now, about 45 students have attended our computer classes. Several have developed computer&nbsp;skills</p>

                    <p>Summary of&nbsp;Accomplishments</p>
<p>•	Seven Pillsbury United Communities Technology Centers have improved their infrastructure. Staff was trained to administer their technology Center<br />
•	Created a “help” manual for each center including a Universal set of computer lab rules<br />
•	Met with Technology Center administrators of each center, to assess individual needs and provide assistance when ever possible.<br />
•	Four volunteers have been recruited for Waite House<br />
•	Upcoming Web site design class for Pillsbury United Communities Technology Center administrators, so they can teach community members at their particular location. This class will be taught by corporate volunteers.<br />
•	Assisted in the creation of an additional lab, or “Business Center” for community members<br />
•	Created promotional materials.<br />
•	Attended UNCA conference, attended workshop on how to recruit volunteers from Volunteer Resource Center and will attend “Minnesota Trainers or Trainers on Adult Learning” seminar in&nbsp;April. </p>
<p>Volunteer&nbsp;Recruitment</p>
<p>Several community members were exposed to computers for the first time during our “open Business Center hours” on Wednesday from 11:00- 1:00 pm. Volunteer staff assisted those community members in discovering the world of technology and the advantages of becoming computer literate. About 80% of these new computer users were recruited from Waite House Community café.  This Waite House service provides hot meal to low income, working families, and homeless&nbsp;people. </p>
<p>A similar strategy was implemented in the afternoons when people waited to be served by our food shelf staff. Every afternoon from 2:00-5:00 pm at least 20-25 people line up to be served. Carley met with interns from Hamline University to identify potential volunteers who could staff the Business Center during those hours. A Hamline student that wanted to improve her Spanish skills became interested in staffing the business center. She volunteered two hours every Monday from 3:00- 5:00 for ten weeks.  Several seniors were provided service during those hours; their most frequent questions were about how to look for services in the&nbsp;Internet.</p>
<p>Direct&nbsp;Service</p>
<p>Carley and David met once a week, two hours for five weeks. David learned to navigate the Internet to do job search. He also signed up with an e-mail provider. He developed basic skills on the use of Microsoft Word. David also developed a resume and cover&nbsp;letter.</p>
<p>Accelerated Reader&nbsp;Software</p>
<p>Carley helped to teach youth workers the use of this software. According to our last quarter report, for September 30th, 2004, two hundred twenty youth are enrolled into the Accelerated Reader program and about 80% of them have advanced one or more reading levels. Waite House alone reports 55 youth enrolled into the program and about 80% of them are now reading at their expected grade&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>ESL&nbsp;Classes</p>
<p>Carley assisted the students to sign up with an e-mail provider. John, the teacher, sent assignments via e-mails. The students had to respond the same way. Students have developed skills in MS word, the Internet and a basic understanding of how computer works.   At least 15 students, so far, have developed a medium level of proficiency on MS&nbsp;Words.  </p>
<p>Thanks to Carley, Waite House English program obtained 15 on line licenses of Rosetta Stone English software for 2004-05. Carley took the initiative to search foundations and came across Rosetta’s foundation.  The Market value of these 15 licenses is approximately $1,900.00. Thank you&nbsp;Carley.</p>

                    <p>Luke has developed and enhanced three curricula: PC Basics, ESOL PC Basics, and a middle school technology curriculum.  He recruited and trained volunteers to teach these curricula and established relationships with community partners to fill gaps where needed.  All three of these curricula have been placed on the World Wide Web on the Durham County Literacy Council  (DCLC) homepage for use by other non-profits or schools.  Additionally, Luke greatly improved the sustainability of DCLC’s technology infrastructure, as well as our partner&nbsp;agencies’.</p>

                    <p>Once the VISTA completed the development of the PC Basics curriculum in the spring of 2002, the VISTA recruited and trained 6 volunteers.  Consequently 4 classes were taught entirely by volunteers. A total of 39 students enrolled with 26 finishing the&nbsp;class.</p>
<p>The VISTA developed the PC Basics curriculum in Spanish using lessons in Spanish found on the Internet, translating current lessons from the classes taught in English, and creating new lessons.  The curriculum in Spanish is now posted on the Internet.  The classes in Spanish have been taught by a group of 5&nbsp;volunteers.</p>
<p>The curriculum for middle school technology classes was completed and posted on the Internet.  Students began taking the NC Computer Skills test in March – 19 students successfully&nbsp;passed.</p>
<p>Technical Infrastructure Capacity-Building<br />
Luke also achieved the following technology objectives for&nbsp;DCLC:</p>
<p>-Configured Linux server for file sharing and email<br />
-Set up all workstations to run ABE/GED and ESOL software from the DCLC server<br />
-Inventoried and setup all laptops in mobile lab for categorized use<br />
-Prepared tech help sheets for all tasks so that someone else could do them<br />
-Inventoried software on all workstations and set them up to have appropriate software, including virus protection software<br />
-Worked on computers at partner site and troubleshot 8 PCs to get GED/Pre-GED software working<br />
-Ran the summer camp computer time at the YMCA for school-aged&nbsp;children</p>

                    <p>Victoria concentrated efforts this year on stabilizing community computer class offerings to reach adult community members in Mattawa, Royal City, and Othello. The first half of her term was spent generating community computer classes, developing more classes in each community, and training volunteers through Central Washington University (CWU) GEARUP.  The second half of the term was focused on expanding that interest to self-study and home use, and to continue the access to learning.  During the course of the year, over 130 users were involved in introductory computer classes and intermediate level classes.  Students logged roughly 1400 user hours.  Among other things, these classes built community capacity, strengthened a cadre of volunteers, and led BBCC to develop partnerships and open new computer classes in Mattawa, Royal City and Othello that were geared to second language&nbsp;learners.</p>

                    <p>Victoria refined and implemented a second language (Spanish) curriculum that was used in the computer classes.  She based the curriculum on research done with a variety of programs working with second language students.  CWU GEARUP linked with Victoria to provide work study students to teach computer classes in the three communities.  CWU recruited bilingual campus students who then taught the computer classes under the guidance of the VISTA program.   One of the CWU GEARUP program objectives is to increase knowledge and awareness of post secondary education for the families with children in these three communities.  Increasing the family’s access to technology is a link to their literacy growth and improves success in school.  Victoria also developed a strong relationship with the RECA Foundation in Kennewick and continued to link community members to the foundation so they could purchase refurbished computers at a low cost for their home use.  We have learned that real progress for most students is dependant on computers in the home.  Victoria was able to get computers into many of the student’s homes in Royal City and Mattawa and to help them keep these computers working.  The computers are geared more towards families and give kids a basis for learning.  They have security in place to prevent major problems from occurring to the operating system.  The major drawback in these computers is that they do not allow changes to the system and prevent use of the internet.  However, as a beginning computer for families, they are perfect because they aren’t susceptible to viruses as they become more comfortable with the computers, they can later invest in one that is Internet ready. In the meantime, Internet access and ESL software remains available in the community&nbsp;labs.</p>

                    <p>As an Americorps Vista volunteer, Shlonda has supported and enhanced four Durham County Literacy Council (DCLC) projects; the Parent’s Part Family Literacy Project, Techcelerated Pre-GED and GED, PC Basics, English as a Second Language and has gained valuable experience as a teacher and trainer. She has recruited and trained volunteers to teach or assist in all projects.  The VISTA has maintained a working relationship with partner sites CET, NCCU and the&nbsp;YMCA.  </p>
<p>Shlonda successfully taught Parents’ Part in Cornwallis Road public housing neighborhood in Durham,&nbsp;NC.  </p>
<p>At the Durham Literacy Council’s main office, Shlonda taught students by using technology-assisted GED&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>As a tutor Shlonda has taught ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) classes, which includes creating lesson plans, leading small group conversations and trained new tutors to teach the traditional and computer-assisted ESL&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>Shlonda has been instrumental in establishing and maintaining an after school program for Kestrel Heights Charter&nbsp;School.</p>
<p>Shlonda has improved technical support at the Literacy Council, Kestrel Heights Charter School and assisted in maintaining and installing computers in all&nbsp;labs.</p>
<p>Career Passport is a portfolio or notebook containing documents certifying you have met specific academic and workplace standards.  The latest implementation is the Internet career interest/personality inventory.  Shlonda is the field test manager of this project and has successful coached 4 individuals in completing their portfolio.  Shlonda expanded upon DLC’s Career Passport by initiating mini-workshops with focus areas such as “Preparing for the Job Interview.”  The project is now nationally recognized and endorsed by the Literacy Volunteers of America.

                    <p>In addition to maintaining regular support to existing volunteers at the center, Mary met with existing partners to discuss potential additional programs:<br />
•	Project Farewell, University Presbyterian Church - G.E.D. program<br />
•	Inside/Outside Children’s Museum Art Program, Youth Web Design<br />
•	Arranged tax assistance dates with Tax Aides (formerly VITA) and Deloitte and Touche in February and early March; began advertising those dates in the community<br />
•	Family Literacy program, offered in partnership with REWA, two nights a week 4-6 participants per evening.<br />
•	Employment assistance offered by Neighborhood House employment specialists two afternoons a week.<br />
•	Intermediate ESL program, offered in partnership with the Seattle Literacy Council, two nights a week. Many participants are working with the goal of entering the G.E.D. class we are hoping to offer in early April.<br />
•	Talked with Student Nursing program to about creating a health related resource on RVLT website.<br />
•	Discussed RV Peace Pole project with Keesha Morris – explored funding opportunities for the project<br />
•	Researched available job resources for teens in preparation for a preliminary conversation on creating a youth employment services program at RV. Scheduled initial meeting for early March with Jobs Plus, RVLT, Boys and Girls Club, Youth Tutoring program, and Neighborhood&nbsp;House. </p>
<p>Held 2 tax nights with volunteers from Deloitte and Touche and 2 tax Saturdays with a volunteer from Tax Aide. All efforts were very successful! – 35 income tax returns were prepared for Rainier Vista residents. One additional tax day will be held on March&nbsp;1. </p>
<p>Job Referral program and ESL courses continued in February. Both programs saw “slow and steady” upwards acceptance and attendance levels from the community. The ESL course expanded beyond its initial limit of 7 students, so a second teacher from the Seattle Literacy Council comes in during the same time to teach the additional&nbsp;students. </p>
<p>Due to limited resources, the sustainability plan for the CTC is to partner with agencies providing services needed by residents through agreements to provide facilities in exchange for those services.  This is also meant to address resident concern about loss of funding for the employment program which included job search, job retention and wage progression&nbsp;activities.  </p>
<p>In addition to all of this, Mary is creating the volunteer manual, which will include information on:<br />
•	the basic care and maintenance of the computers<br />
•	center rules<br />
•	troubleshooting<br />
•	typical skills and help requested of&nbsp;volunteers</p>
<p>America Connects Consortium Data Collection Curriculum project:<br />
Mary has utilized her web and research expertise to identify and assess free online databases and tracking software for use in CTCs.  Also through her need to assess data requirements under a new service delivery plan, she has acted as a wonderful model for coordinator concerns about data collection requirements for&nbsp;sustainability.</p>
<p>Fundraising: researched Fremont Public Association AmeriCorps VISTA grant and submitted the segments of the grant which she was able to complete to RVLT for approval and decision making needed to complete the grant. Because of an overload of work due to the change in leadership, RVLT decided this was not a priority. Mary is continuing to research additional grants for software and lab&nbsp;funding.</p>

                    <p>Our CTC classes ended with a great joy. Four of our citizenship students passed the test while two failed, and five students are waiting for their appointment. However with very limit number of computers and Internet, we were able to put together a fun computer class for all 20 adult students.  These 20 students are now ready to type letter using Microsoft Word. Using all the skills they learned they are able to create letters, resumes, tables, and flyers. Only few of the older students are having problems remembering basic skills such as opening and saving files in Microsoft Word.  Although most of the computers in the center are old, we were able to have at least 3 computers with Internet access. With great help from our volunteers, one on one tutor is so effective in teaching Internet skills to these students. More than half of these students are now getting online chatting with relatives in Vietnam and setting up email accounts.  All of the ESL students are still shy to talk in English especially complete Standard&nbsp;English.</p>

                    <p>I am currently a Community Technology Center (CTC) VISTA working at BPSOS’s national headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia.  Thus, the primary goal for this year of service is to assist in the management of a Community Technology Center: a centrally-located space providing technological access to community members who would otherwise not have said&nbsp;access.</p>
<p>Goal 1:  Set up and operate CTC<br />
Goal 2:  Provide computer skills/ English skills to target population.<br />
Goal 3:  Assist community groups in setting up CTCs.<br />
Goal 4:  Produce a video on BPSOS CTCs/Survivor Services Dept.<br />
Goal 5:  Make the FAIR program self-sufficient<br />

                    <p>Between the months of September and December, I worked with my fellow VISTA, Co Kim Oanh, and my supervisor, Bach Pham, to reaffirm community contacts by recruiting volunteers, outreaching to prospective clients, and acquiring space for a CTC.  While Bach worked with BPSOS’s IT guy to acquire computers, I focused on recruiting volunteers to teach a series of Computer Literacy/ESL classes to current BPSOS clients. Through websites and phone calls, we recruited a small group of 4-5 volunteers that agreed to teach ESL/Computer Literacy combo&nbsp;classes.</p>
