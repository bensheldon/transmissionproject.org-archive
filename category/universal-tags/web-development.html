                    <p>HandyCapable Network promotes self-sufficiency and enriches the lives of people with disabilities or people who are otherwise socially or economically challenged by providing training in and access to computer&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Marketing</p>
<p>1. Develop partnerships to receive donations of computers for&nbsp;refurbishing. </p>
<p>2. Develop ways to distribute computers beyond the needs of new CLCs established by HCN.  For instance, building on current relationships with social service non-profits to put computers in homes of low-income families; explore computers for after school programs; provide computers for non-profit office&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>3.Develop a marketing and public relations plan and implement that plan toward the goals of community awareness, gaining financial support and computer donations. Plan to include print, radio, tv media, and website and other online&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>4. Develop or revise marketing materials to support both of these efforts including: 1) letters to potential computer donors; 2)  Project description/brochure; 3) Edit and distribute two newsletters for the program as a support to marketing and fundraising&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<p>Fundraising</p>
<p>1. Develop a one hour &#8220;tour&#8221; program, and host visitors&nbsp;monthly.</p>
<p>2. Develop corporate partnerships that include computer and/or financial&nbsp;donations.</p>
<p>3. Further develop the supporter database to track donations, and to ease communications by letter and email with&nbsp;supporters.</p>
<p>4. Develop an acknowledgment plan to thank donors and recognize&nbsp;donations.</p>
<p>5. Coordinate one or two fundraising&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>Project Coordination&nbsp;Assistance</p>
<p>1. Assist in managing the computer distribution for one or more major projects, including the distribution of computers to 7th grade students at Hairston Middle School in&nbsp;2007-08.</p>

                    <p>Nate developed at least 5 partnerships with various businesses on his own and many smaller individual donors. These connections continue to provide ongoing computers for&nbsp;HCN.</p>
<p>He also negotiated a 200 computer purchase at a very nominal fee, picked them up, loaded and unloaded them, and found a place to have them&nbsp;stored.</p>
<p>Nate revised brochures, and a variety of new donor letters, flyers were&nbsp;completed.</p>
<p>He submitted a grant application to Leadership Greensboro which resulted in a team of four local business leaders to help him develop a marketing package, a promotional DVD (still in the works), a lead database and 3 large computer donors. One donor at a local hospital brings 25-40 computers a&nbsp;month.</p>
<p>Nate was especially successful with media through press releases, resulting in TV news coverage three times (videos on our website), one school distribution had 3 local channels show up to cover it. Another grant he submitted to a Create-A-Thon, a local marketing firm, has resulted in a large banner for use at events. It came in very handy and was used 4 times during Nate&#8217;s&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>He was instrumental in making many updates, changes and fine tuning our website. He developed the Virtual Tour and has agreed to continue to keep the HCN website fresh and up to date. Nate coordinated all computer distributions which included 71 to the families at Hairston Middle School, 77 to Newcomers School (all immigrants from 8 different countries), 60 to another local immigrant community and sometimes with the help of the Executive Director but often on his own he delivered 50 computers to Group homes (for adults with disabilities) throughout the state of NC. These distributions are very time- and staff intensive; having a Vista take the majority of the responsibility helped other staff to do their respective jobs more effectively. Just before he left, Nate submitted a grant for $30,000 for another local school distribution. We recently received the letter stating we were awarded&nbsp;$25,000.</p>
<p>We have a great website, new ongoing partners, so many computers we have to store them off site, new relationships, an inventory database that makes life easier and some big shoes to fill. (We  offered Nate a job, but he declined). We are sustaining Nate&#8217;s work by hiring the previous Vista, Anna Simanovitch, in a part time Admin. Assistant role. We have also worked out a consulting contract with Nate to continue web updates, write grants, help complete the Annual Report and in many other ways we we may need to use his expertise and knowledge of our organization&nbsp;.</p>

                    <p>We would like to host a VISTA member who will develop effective online communications that complement and support program work for ACDC&#8217;s youth program, Asian Voices of Organized Youth for Community Empowerment (A-VOYCE). This person works to inform the development of online strategic initiatives, and assumes primary responsibility for content development and strategy. A-VOYCE serves youth ages 13-19 from the Greater Boston area, with an emphasis on low-income youth from Boston and urban Asian American (AA) communities. This youth development program fosters leadership potential and encourages youth to develop an active voice in their community through two project tracts: producing and leading Chinatown walking tours and producing a weekly radio show that broadcasts on WMFO 91.5 Tuft Community&nbsp;Radio.</p>
<p>The VISTA member will primarily be responsible for creating a strategy to use web 2.0 tools such as, but not limited to, Facebook, Myspace, YouTube, blogs, and wikis,for publicity, marketing, and fundraising purposes.  Depending on the VISTA member&#8217;s interests, s/he will have the opportunity to identify synergistic approaches that align electronic media and web content presentation with enterprise objectives. Possible projects would involve developing an online marketing plan to increase number of paid walking tours or creating a prototype for disseminating the audio walking tour. While the VISTA will not work directly with youth, s/he will be instrumental in growing the youth program by providing a framework for using web based tools and forums to share A-VOYCE projects such as podcasts of our radio shows, oral histories, and excerpts from a forthcoming A-VOYCE literary magazine.  S/he will also work with the youth programs staff to identify best practices for media education and engaging youth in producing web media&nbsp;content.</p>

                    <p>Vilmala has been extraordinary at implementing a web based presense for the A-VOYCE program. Her skill in this areana has helped facilitate more open communication amongst and between the youth. The youth have a strong bond of trust with her and she has been a good role model and capable teacher for them. She has done a remarkable job at running the radio station, something she had no experience with before she came to ACDC. She is fearless when it comes to tackling challenges and issues and she does it with minimal&nbsp;supervision.</p>
<p>Shortly after she arrived at ACDC, we had the opportunity to partner with the CITGO-Venezuela Energy Efficient Lighting Program in partnership with Citizens Programs Corporation to implement a pilot program that would provide compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) and energy efficiency education. The Program provided low-income households with educational materials on energy efficiency and energy-saving compact fluorescent light bulbs. Vimala took the project on and became proficient at delivering workshops and training to the Chinese community where she did not speak the language and faced overwhelming interest. ACDC was literally flooded with requests and the project took on a life of it&#8217;s own. Vimala handled this by recruiting chinese speaking residents to assist in teaching workshops and helping to handle the volume of people who flooded to ACDC to participate in the program. It also required a lot of community outreach, translation of materials and finding ways to communicate when there were cultural and linguistic barriers. The program was a smashing success, in large measure, because of Vimala&#8217;s attention to detail and open communication with board, staff, volunteers and community members. The program raised $22,972 for A-VOYCE which was a real boost for the&nbsp;program.</p>

In the process she taught youth new web tools and created a way for them to freely communicate back and forth. She stepped up to the plate and ran the Energy Efficiency Program, which served over 1000 low-income community residents. We would not have had the staff capacity to run the program otherwise.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>Laura developed a grant narrative for Monster.com for Grassroots.org’s volunteer program. This comprehensive document will be very useful in the development of future proposals. She also developed a needs statement (a crucial development document the organization was lacking) that was submitted along with five proposals this year and will be submitted along with all future grant&nbsp;proposals.</p>
<p>She helped to create and then managed Grassroots.org’s volunteer graphic design program. In five months, there were more than 20 graphic design projects completed: <a href="http://volunteer.grassroots.org/image/tid/2" title="http://volunteer.grassroots.org/image/tid/2">http://volunteer.grassroots.org/image/tid/2</a>.</p>
<p>Laura built upon upon Grassroots.org’s community of web design volunteers from 90 to over 400 through social networking and volunteer requests on Craigslist, SmartVolunteer and Volunteer Match. Laura documented the process, which could be replicated by another staff&nbsp;member.</p>
<p>She developed web content and mailings for Holiday Giving Campaign, which can be publicized annually: <a href="http://www.grassroots.org/holidaygiving" title="http://www.grassroots.org/holidaygiving">http://www.grassroots.org/holidaygiving</a> Helped grow the individual giving program, including handling administrative tasks&nbsp;associated.</p>
<p>Laura assisted in acquiring and managing a grant from google.com for $10,000/ month in ad words. She helped to develop and implement four significant new program service offerings. Helped reestablish our facebook presence and create a new twitter presence. We grew from 0 to 2,160 twitter followers in four months. We have grown our membership from 680 members to over 2,000. We have increased the rate of usage for our tools. In previous years, we averaged about $200,000 in free services being given away. In the past year we have given away over $2 million.

                    <p>The Coalition for Asian Pacific American Youth is a project of the Asian American Studies Program at University of Massachusetts Boston.  It builds the leadership of Asian American high school students in the greater Boston area through the development and implementation of youth-led projects.  We believe that youth united by a common cause can make a&nbsp;difference.</p>
<p>The following are the types of activities that the AmeriCorps VISTA member will&nbsp;accomplish:</p>
<p>1. Program and Curriculum Planning and Implementation&#8211; The No. One priority of the school in the coming year is to upgrade and update the school’s curriculum. Under the leadership and guidance of the Programs <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Curriculum Committee (PCC) members, the VISTA volunteer will be an active participant in the planning process and will help implement recommendations made by the PCC through out the&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>2. Systematize School Operations and Procedures&#8211; A critical task is to create a reference source for the school’s operations and procedures. The VISTA volunteer will lead the development and production of a set of school handbooks. There will be a general school handbook, a handbook customized for the needs of the teachers and one customized for the students. The development and production of the bi-lingual English/Chinese handbooks will be a collaborative effort with the participation of the school Board and&nbsp;staff.</p>
<p>3. Create/Update Bi-lingual Schools Forms and Pamphlets&#8211; Working with the staff and the Programs <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Curriculum Committee, the VISTA volunteer will be the project leader in updating or creating program description pamphlets; tuition and tuition assistance, and enrollment forms. The staff will assisted in getting all communications materials translated into Chinese. As part of the need to systematize the school operations, the VISTA volunteer will assist in the creation of a student database to capture student profile, track attendance, tuition payment history, et&nbsp;al.</p>
<p>4. Update and Upgrade the School&#8217;s Bilingual Website&#8211; In collaboration with the website volunteer and using information gathered under Items 2 and 3, the VISTA volunteer will lead in the upgrading, updating, and monitoring of the school&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>5. Create a Template to Start a Parent Teacher Association&#8211; In collaboration with the Board and staff and using standard PTA guidelines, the VISTA volunteer will develop the mission/vision and sustainable, start-up goals and programs for a PTA. Once the PTA handbook is approved by the Board, the VISTA volunteer will assist in the start-up phase of the&nbsp;PTA.</p>

                    <p>n the beginning, Katrina centered on constructing infrastructure in KKCS&#8217;s practices and procedures. She has worked with the Head of School to develop institutional policies and procedures, and worked diligently to implement effective and efficient practices in the After School Program. Through recruiting and training volunteers, she has expanded the number of people working with students, thus lessening the student to teacher radio. She has worked to build an efficient Healthy Snack Program which provides the After School students with nutritious and balanced snacks every day. Katrina also has her sights set on the long term impacts that technology can make on KKCS and has been a part of the planning process for our student and school database. Through these and many more tasks, her comprehensive understanding of both the day to day operation as well as the long term goals have helped to bring KKCS to a higher&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>For the first time, Math/English is offered in the After-School program. Katrina designed the curriculum which follows the Boston Public School standards, recruited student teachers from colleges and Boston Latin School to teach these subjects two days a week for two hours each day. Katrina has also provided additional resources such as lesson planning templates, sample lesson plans and best practices. The Math/English program continues to be offered in the After-School&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Though Katrina drafted several of the school handbooks, none were adopted. In an effort to gain input and feedback, it was hoped that separate constituient committees conisisting of teachers, parents and students would be formed. This was not done. Time and resources were the challenge. KKCS&#8217;s website updating was not addressed by the school administration. The Parent Teacher Association had several starts, but did not get organized. This is a brand new concept to KKCS; the appropriate leadership needs to be&nbsp;identified.</p>

                    <p>Morgan&#8217;s primary focus has been on the complete redesign of the NAMAC website &#8211; from complex technical programming to taxonomization of data and content to social networking and blogging. It launched in the end of August and is becoming the nervous system of the NAMAC offerings. We are very happy with the results and look forward to our next phase of community building online, educating our membership in social networking through the site, and extending its reach to other nonprofits, communities and the public. Morgan has been a kind, reponsive and patient staff member throughout this process, always thinking strategically about how our online offerings can benefit new members, communities and&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>Morgan wrote an article about the website-building process for our member newsletter and produced a short video on how to use the site to its maximum capability. Now he is transitioning into the role of online community manager. He is managing our website content, troubleshooting any technical problems, and most importantly creating an online community of dedicated users from the NAMAC membership and other nonprofits, to the public&nbsp;at-large.</p>
<p>It was a hard challenge to solve a lot of the technical problems that the transistion to a Drupal environment posed. But we were very pleased to see that not only was Morgan a problem solver, but he was a solution seeker, reaching out continuously to the technical community and his network of programmers to find ways to deal with the small to large issues that would&nbsp;arise.</p>

                    <p>The &#8220;NPO Digital Literacy Toolkit and Virtual Volunteer Initiative&#8221; project is a combination of community networking, technology assistance to nonprofits, and digital media. We believe that with the advent of new web tools, we have an opportunity to reach populations we have not reached before, and provide them access to a more accessible and empowering&nbsp;internet.</p>
<p>Over the year, our Vista will be involved in the following&nbsp;activities:</p>
<p>- help identify representative segments of our community and assess their communications needs<br />
- become familiar with and adept at using DCN&#8217;s existing toolkit<br />
- explore and test next generation digital tools and open source applications provided by various national and international organizations<br />
- help coordinate the development and testing of prototype toolkits which use next generation tools<br />
- help develop and implement a train-the-trainers curriculum<br />
- create recommended volunteer procedures and systems that could be generalized to other community organizations, an online guide for volunteer management for use by local nonprofits, the template for an online volunteer handbook<br />
- develop DCN’s procedures and systems (and a draft online guide) for volunteer management, test the NPO Digital Literacy Toolkit’s use for DCN’s purposes to recruit and manage volunteers, and develop a draft online volunteer handbook for DCN<br />
- work with DCN to promote development and hosting of local rich media content,<br />
such as blogs and vlogs, podcasts, digital storytelling, etc and explore opportunities to develop this type of content for hosting on the DCN&nbsp;website</p>

                    <p>Working independently, Rian collected examples of Web 2.0 tools, resources related to them, case studies, and effective practices. She designed and developed a website to share this information broadly. She assisted in the development of several slide presentations on subjects ranging from electronic newsletters to databases and effective practices in the use of these technologies. Rian also developed recommendations for DCN&#8217;s volunteer management program, including a volunteer manual, and created on-line resources for other nonprofits to use in developing their own volunteer management&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>Once the resources were collected into an invaluable website by Rian, a small team of technical liaisons were able to use them in supporting five pilot organizations, including the Food Bank of Yolo County, Yolo Community Foundation, Short-Term Emergency Action Committee, TREEDavis, and Davis Community Network itself. These technical liaisons are volunteers, and it made their jobs much easier to conduct strategic communications planning with the nonprofits, identify their target audiences for the pilot period, messages they wanted to use the Internet to deliver, what they wanted their audiences to do, and finally, what Internet tools (from the collection of resources on the website), would help them to carry out their strategic communications plan. Without of all Rian&#8217;s up-front work, these volunteers could not have been immediately helpful to the organizations, to help them set up their websites in a sustainable way (so that they are not dependent on DCN&#8217;s volunteers to maintain them), to develop online webforms for simple contact management, electronic newsletters, and community calendars. In addition, Rian led a team to evaluate more sophisticated collaborative, communication, and contact management tools for DCN to use, to model potential future uses of tools such as Google Apps and Salesforce, when local nonprofits (with our help), become more sophisticated in their use of the&nbsp;Internet.</p>
<p>The major challenge for Rian was that DCN did not have an executive director during most of the term of her assignment, which meant that she was supervised, first by a team of volunteers, and then by a single volunteer. While she was able to carry out assignments once they were framed, and she worked well independently, she (and the organization) would have benefited from supervision by a staff&nbsp;person.</p>

  presentations of their own work<br />
- Developing a plan and infrastructure for uploading presentations to web and<br />
  distributing presentations to multiple,diverse audiences; plan/infrastructure<br />
  should emphasize use of new networking/technology tools like YouTube and MySpace<br />
- Creating an introductory webpage for Appalshop’s Film Division that includes<br />
  articles, interviews, and audio and video pieces about Appalshop Films’ history<br />
  and current work<br />
- Using work from Appalshop&#8217;s Media Archive to create issue- or topic-specific web<br />
  presentations and distributing them to key, yet diverse, web&nbsp;audiences</p>
<p>All web presentations will support Appalshop’s mission to involve the people of Appalachia in the representation of their culture, traditions, and&nbsp;stories.</p>
