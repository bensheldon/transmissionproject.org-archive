Her work in the CTC involved development of curriculum and outcomes for our computer literacy education program and increasing the use of the CTC as an independent learning center.  She also assisted with teaching classes and individual learning&nbsp;projects.  </p>
<p>As a mentor she supported and empowered our staff, all former program participants, through building their computer skills, and supporting their growth in organizational leadership.  Through modeling, working with recruiting and cultivating volunteers, she mobilized and supported student involvement in a variety of&nbsp;activities.</p>

She also organized and laid a system for grant development accumulating appropriate materials which contributed to the efficiency of grant&nbsp;development. </p>

                    <p>HOLA’s AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, Ashley Cross, has been an amazing addition to Heart of Los Angeles Youth (HOLA). You need only visit our new and improved website to see the many ways that she has made a tremendous impact upon the organization.  At <a href="http://www.heartofla.org" title="www.heartofla.org">www.heartofla.org</a> you will see updated stories and press releases which Ashley designed and published.  She also designed and formatted a link for point of donation opportunities, as well as a merchandizing page featuring HOLA cards designed by our youth.  HOLA has received close to $3,000 in donations through our website to date, which funds can be directly attributed to Ashley’s efforts.  We also received a $50,000 grant that came through our new and improved site. Please take a look at the home page and the articles included on the site, which Ashley was responsible for designing and formatting.  Ashley was able to recreate on our web site the entire article about HOLA, including photographs, which was published in “La Opinion”.  She was responsible for creating the Special Events page and many of the stories and pictures throughout the site.  At the same time, we have been able to hard copies of the PDF articles from the web site to form an integral part of HOLA’s press packet.  Ashley’s contribution to the HOLA website is only one very critical part of how she&#8217;s expanded the capacity for our&nbsp;organization.  </p>
<p>Ashley succeeded in refurbishing the 30 laptops ahead of schedule, but the organization encountered some unforeseen obstacles in procuring battery packs, a wireless router, wireless cards, and most importantly, a space to accommodate the Mobile Lab Project.  Thanks to Ashley’s research, these were obtained during the last quarter of her term. While these challenges were being addressed, we added the new goal of increasing the capacity of HOLA’s development office through the overall improvement of the website, which Ashley undertook with great efficiency and&nbsp;success. </p>
<p>The Mobile Lab Project is now slated to be unveiled in March or April of 2006, a successful culmination of Ashley’s research and development efforts.  Batteries, cards and a router have been obtained, and funds have been secured for the build-out of the new Teen&nbsp;Center.</p>

                    <p>Ashley’s ability to accomplish tasks quickly has greatly enhanced HOLA’s public image, giving a much-needed dynamic quality to the website, much to the organization’s benefit.  Because she finished the Mobile Laptop Project in such a timely manner, HOLA was able to gain additional financial support from national companies towards launching a new Teen Center.  Ashley successfully adapted to the new goals as they evolved during the year, and she was able to complete the tasks set out for her before the end of her contract.  Fortunately for Heart of Los Angeles Youth, Ashley’s next post will be as a full-time staff member.  She joined HOLA’s staff as the Bridges After School Manager and Volunteer Coordinator on September 19,&nbsp;2005.</p>

                    <p>The last few months have brought about many new challenges for our seasoned VISTA veteran.  Now fully operating under the umbrella of the CMC as my special staff person, Jason has worked on coordinating many of our Public Relations and Marketing efforts.  He has been instrumental in establishing a presentation standard for CMC tours, which are happening more regularly under his watch.   He has created a routine press release mailing that has resulted in continuing media interest and exposure in CMC&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>Jason has been instrumental in coordinating the special events that CMC has sponsored or hosted.  He has willingly shouldered the duty of making appearances at public functions as the CMC representative, recently meeting the esteemed Governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm, the morning after her State of the State&nbsp;Address.  </p>
<p>Other special events include the nationally recognized educational broadcast of the JASON XIV Project. This weeklong workshop was at held at local gathering place Celebration Cinema where Jason led the CMC’s presence, reaching out to the youth of our community.  This high-profile event that was attended by many of Kent County’s eight graders and was broadcast 24/7 on GRTV’s second channel&nbsp;LiveWire.  </p>
<p>Most recently, Jason coordinated a visit from Detective Sullivan (Oprah Winfrey, the Today Show, and others have featured his new book and software), who teaches Cyber-Safety to school children and their parents.  In addition to his interview during drive-time on WYCE 88.1FM, our sponsorship of his visit has resulted in exposure in the Grand Rapids Family&nbsp;Magazine.</p>
<p>Jason has helped the CMC become the production house for the statewide broadband mapping initiative “LinkMichigan.”  He designed the LinkMichigan brochure and has recently taken over the large task of redesigning the “FREE Internet Access” brochure that includes a map, location, and hours for every public Internet Access site in Barry, Ionia, and Kent Counties.

                    <p>Karen &#8220;Cookie&#8221; Sheers has provided amazing service to our Technology Goes Home program.  She has been very organized and proactive.  When I originally started my position in May 2003, Cookie informed me that our Alumni Committee was inactive.  However she stated that she wanted to work hard to build the alumni committee and get it up and running.  Originally out of the 86 families that graduated from this program, less than 2% remained in touch.  To date, we have had a 10% increase in participants.  This is partly attributed to Cookie placing personal telephone calls, and sending out personal letters to the&nbsp;families.</p>
<p>Cookie also has a childcare background and she is a very outgoing person.  As a result many parents approached her regarding an after school program.  It is because of her sharing their concerns with us that the Y.E.S program was developed and Cookie is taking the lead on this project.  She is a tremendous asset to Dorchester Bay Economic Development&nbsp;Corporation.</p>

                    <p>Scott came to BNN in September 2002.  He quickly became a valuable member of the BNN team, assisting with Ed/Out projects that promote BNN services, teaching video production, assisting members with non-linear editing, troubleshooting edit equipment, and producing public service announcements.  Scott has raised the production standards of BNN with his excellent editing and shooting skills.  He has also assisted with print promotions such as newsletters and&nbsp;flyers.</p>
<p>Due to Scott’s excellent production capabilities he was able to complete a number of PSAs, instructional videos, and community based programs for BNN.  Such programs included the 10 part series &#8220;Sister Talk 2,&#8221; a program aimed at African American women to raise awareness of cardiovascular health.  Scott assisted Barbara Barrow-Murray, BNN’s Roxbury Studio Manager, with editing the series.  Scott also played a large role in helping to modernize the look of the channel, creating promotional spots, and helping to improve the channel’s&nbsp;graphics.</p>

                    <p>Brenda Jackson began her work as a VISTA volunteer with PLUK in June of 2002. Her principal goal has been to further develop the technology center programs, outreach to other community organizations and sustainability. We’ve come a long way and then some with Brenda’s assistance.  The centerpiece has been funding for a state-wide tutoring program for at-risk children which is headquartered within the technology center. Brenda was a participant in an eight-month program for training collaborative teams around the state to evaluate technology needs for individuals with disabilities. We continue to benefit from her efforts by being awarded a Beaumont Foundation Grant she had written for a mobile lab to be used for&nbsp;training.</p>

                    <p>Brenda made great steps in developing the programs of the technology center. These steps include: increasing the number of support volunteers for all programs, reaching out to other organizations that are trying to develop technology centers within their communities, researching funding options, applying for funding to ensure sustainability, developing a marketing plan for public awareness, presenting to groups, organizing training events in the center, and slowly increasing the quantity and quality of the programs in the center along with developing the&nbsp;infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>One of the many capacity building functions Jason has provided has been with media support for a brand new federally funded grant project MOLLIE. Working with the CMC video artist in residence, Jason produced a promotional video that will help insure the future of this fledgling project that is only funded for a year. In addition, he extended GRTV outreach efforts by providing much needed video help to local non-profits who otherwise could not afford&nbsp;it.</p>

                    <p>Jason became a key participant in making our Spring Alliance for Community Media conference a success. With his local connections with artists, Jason put on an art installation that included a live broadcast on Channel 24 Livewire, interactive wireless video transmission, and addressed contemporary issues with technology and community&nbsp;development/education. </p>
<p>His most recent contribution to the future of this organization, relates to his new job description. As Public information officer, Jason is using his graphic design skills to create a new&#8221;image and look&#8221; for the CMC. Now we have someone doing regular press releases, sending out event information to local calendars, and supporting the CMC outreach efforts. The CMC looks forward to Jason&#8217;s second year of&nbsp;service.</p>

<p>In the tradition of <span class="caps">PRPD</span> Conferences past, this year&#8217;s gathering will also inspire. You will hear prominent public radio voices and those outside our industry not just explain where we are as an industry but where we are going and how to get there despite &#8211; or because of &#8211; the troubled&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s program includes sessions designed to help PDs and content professionals not just survive but thrive in these changing times.  Attend, and you will return to your station armed with new knowledge&nbsp;about:</p>
<p>          o<br />
            programming on multiple platforms<br />&nbsp;o</p>
