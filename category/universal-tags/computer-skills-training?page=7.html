<p>Objective 2: All Vistas Have had over 10 days of&nbsp;training.</p>
<p>Objective 3: Victoria has provided support services to all 516&nbsp;graduates</p>
<p>Objective 4: Victoria has scheduled Workshops for 414 graduates since she started. She has assisted in the recruitment of 24 volunteers. Victoria is part of the new and old equipment teams. These teams are responsible for the dispensing and acquiring of all computers and component parts.Victoria has assisted in the scheduling of 24&nbsp;volunteers,</p>
<p>Objective 5: We have received funding from foundations for over $90,000. We fell short of our objective to raise $8,000 from faith based organizations and $14,000 in individual donations. We received $7,100 from faith based organizations and $10,000 from individuals. We have received a continuation from the City of Lansing Economic Development Initiative and increased the funding to&nbsp;$40,000.</p>
<p>One of the major problems our program has encountered in the past is the overwhelming popularity our program; we have reduced our waiting list to the point that that a new applicant is able to attend class in 6-8 months. We have a new internet service provider ACD.NET who has generously agreed to provide all of the Closing the Digital Gap’s graduates with free 1 year internet service.  We have come along way in a short period of time, but we still have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p>

                    <p>Located in the heart of San Francisco&#8217;s Mission District, CAMINOS enables low-income, Latina immigrants to create opportunities for self and economic improvement through access to technology. CAMINOS is a non-profit organization dedicated to using technology to improve the lives of Latina immigrants. By enabling unemployed or underemployed Latina, immigrant women move from manual or service labor to office and technology-based work, thus interrupting the cycle of poverty and social isolation affecting Latina immigrant women&#8217;s health and&nbsp;wellbeing.</p>
<p>CAMINOS works to ensure that low-income Latina immigrant women in the community can reap the benefits of the information revolution that is fundamentally changing our economic and social structure. Without programs such as ours, poor communities would miss the opportunity to be integrated into the technological era, further exacerbating existing equity&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Our programs work together to empower Latina immigrant women to build living-wage careers within the information and technology&nbsp;sector.dive</p>

                    <p>Sharon has shown only the utmost dedication to the Cyber Y and has helped nurture our afterschool programming into a highly successful and sought after community afterschool option for our neighborhood. The first class was an overwhelming success with high retention and participation from our local 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders. This semester we added one day of programming and now offer Cyber Y afterschool for 3rd and 4th together and a separate class for the 5th&nbsp;graders. </p>
<p>In addition, Sharon has also worked closely with the Cyber Seniors class that meets once a week and provides ongoing instruction support and recruitment for the class. She also developed an open access time one morning a week in order to provide additional out of class time to participants to have more computer usage time. Starting with only a couple of attendees, word of mouth has quickly filled up this morning&nbsp;time.</p>

The Center is located at the Flanagan Center, a neighborhood tenant facility through the Lowell Housing Authority. The RRCTC focuses on functional computer skills designed to enhance employment and educational pursuits. We currently offer a five-days per week after-school program that works with kids ages 7-17 on computer skills that will enhance their educational experience. The program works in conjunction with the tutoring program at the Center administered by Casey Family Services and the Boy’s Club. The computer curriculum promotes basic skill acquisition as well as project-based learning in community organization, education and leadership. The program is open to all youth living in the Lowell Housing&nbsp;Authority.</p>

1.Creating a strong network infrastructure that is affordable, stable and easy to manage for non-tech people.<br />
2.Developing a website presence and plan for 3 local nonprofits.<br />
3.Contributing to the development of a Computer Training book to teach Microsoft Office programs to adult learners. Progress has been made toward completing the Excel&nbsp;training.</p>

                    <p>In terms of capacity building, we have had the greatest success with goal 1.  Kevin has been leading the project to transfer our network from a Windows to a Linux operating system, while training two staff members to be able to take on the technical duties when he&nbsp;leaves.</p>
<p>With regard to goal 2, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Lowell site is essentially complete, although has not been launched due to decisions still to be made on the part of the club. Unfortunately, we fell short on this goal, which was to complete three sites by the end of Kevin’s term. .  We hope to have Kevin create a template that can be used by other nonprofits that would like a&nbsp;website. </p>
<p>As a result of Kevin’s work on goal 3, we have a rough draft of the first part of a project based Excel training near completion, and hope to have the beta version done by Kevin&#8217;s&nbsp;departure. </p>
<p>We had two other goals Kevin was going to work on that we did not pursue. One was helping with the development of an information-interviewing library; the other was working on developing a volunteer program for the Lowell Community Technology&nbsp;Consortium.</p>

                    <p>This year has been successful, for we conducted the following classes here at the Riley Hill Technology Center:  Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, as well as Introduction to the personal computer. The total number of students attending was 54. As Ella says, “I was blessed with seven volunteer instructors by advertising in the community. I was also privileged to teach Microsoft Word with an Introduction to the Personal&nbsp;Computer.”</p>
<p>A Computer Repair course was developed for Riley Hill Community Technology Center. Ella decided to use two resources to develop this course: Computer Concepts (Third Edition) and Technology for Social Change&#8217;s curriculum (<a href="http://www.tecschange.org" title="www.tecschange.org">www.tecschange.org</a>) with their permission. Ella also planned to use the RTPnet site as a reference for this&nbsp;course.</p>

                    <p>Developing this course has helped Ella to better troubleshoot computers, for there are individuals in the community that are in dire need of help.  These individuals bring their personal computers to the center for technical support. In the Wendell Community and surrounding areas, the Riley Hill Technology Center is the only source that does not charge a fee for&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>We very grateful to add our source of Volunteers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Technology Resources. We have used the following sources this year&nbsp;(2003-2004):</p>
<p>•	Schools (K-12) students as well as other personnel<br />
•	Community Colleges<br />
•	Libraries (Public and Other)<br />
•	Local businesses<br />
•	Wake Forest Pediatrics (Wake Forest, NC)<br />
•	Churches (Wakefield, Zebulon First Baptist etc.)<br />
•	RTP.net (Website)<br />
•	Family and Friends of staff members<br />
•	Department of Social Services (Eastern Regional Center, Zebulon)<br />
•	Retired Senior&nbsp;citizens</p>
<p>The quality of life has improved for the youth and adults who have taken computer classes at the center, however updating the computer equipment as well as software is still needed. We are currently looking for funding for this project and for a long-term way of sustaining the center.  The Riley Hill Survey Plan has given some insight on how to get this plan&nbsp;implemented.</p>

She is very dependable, very cooperative, a team player, and continues to be an asset to the Riley Hill Community. Her interaction with others (peers, youth, students, etc.) is outstanding. During this time period, there have not been any negative comments received regarding Ella. To sum it up, I would rate her as &#8216;Consistently Exceeds&#8217; the requirements in all aspects of the job.&#8221;<br />

<p>Working with GCF online training, she has renewed her partnership with them and now facilitates classes of Adult students&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>She is upgrading the computer lab. She has gotten more furniture for the lab. She will be acquiring from Teaming for Technology 20 upgraded units (17 for the lab and 3 to go to students in the community). The Lab will also be re&nbsp;networked.</p>
<p>She is also a Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA) Pride Ambassador. She assists the bus drivers with issues that she can handle to help the bus driver do his job more effectively. She goes to monthly meetings to help in transportation decisions for her community. The perk that comes with this is that she gets to ride the bus free for a&nbsp;year.</p>
