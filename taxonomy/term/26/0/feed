 <title>SWOT Analysis</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/resources/2010/12/swot-analysis</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis corps member Ericha Hager conducted at each of the stations participating in the NorCal Regional Collaborative to identify the best points of collaboration within the group. Ericha conducted individual interviews with staff members at each station (and in some cases, group discussions) and compiled a SWOT analysis focusing on the four areas of emphasis within the collaborative (production; education/youth media; fundraising;&amp;nbsp;technology).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Why is technology missing from CNCS&#039;s strategic plan? </title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/12/why-is-technology-missing-from-cncss-strategic-plan</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency that administers AmeriCorps, is readying its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalservice.gov/pdf/11_1116_strategy_brief_5yr_goals.pdf&quot;&gt;strategic goals for 2011-2015 [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;. Conspicuously absent from its goals or plan is nearly any mention of technology or media. Their proposed priorities&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic Opportunity
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental Stewardship
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disaster Services
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy Futures
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Veterans &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Military Families
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, technology and media can play an important role within each of these 5 priorities, but past experience has shown CNCS reluctant to explore solutions without an explicit mandate, despite a strategy to &amp;#8220;Identify and invest in innovative local solutions, as well as the infrastructure that supports&amp;nbsp;them.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly acknowledging public media and technology infrastructure as a necessity in support of these priorities would enable many critical and impactful projects to receive support from CNCS; support for which they might otherwise be determined&amp;nbsp;ineligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where technology is mentioned is within CNCS&amp;#8217;s strategic goal to fortify management and internal&amp;nbsp;operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNCS is committed to setting and sustaining the highest standards of stewardship. Thus building upon our current infrastructure, we will strengthen and stabilize our IT systems, grantmaking and grant management processes, human capital and transparency efforts so that CNCS is optimally positioned to enable grantees and service participants to&amp;nbsp;succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A focus on building IT capacity internally would be valuable, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalservice.gov/about/newsroom/releases_detail.asp?tbl_pr_id=1906&quot;&gt;CNCS&amp;#8217;s 2010 annual report&lt;/a&gt; recently announced &amp;#8220;First high-speed internet access for 35 of the 52 field&amp;nbsp;offices&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalservice.gov/pdf/11_1103_strategic_plan_public_input_report.pdf&quot;&gt;Listening sessions with CNCS stakeholders [PDF]&lt;/a&gt; over the proposed 5-year strategic goals have identified the opportunity a focus on technology can offer for&amp;nbsp;CNCS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Challenges&lt;/em&gt;: Participants cited challenges related to access to opportunities, as well as at-risk populations in need of skills development and job&amp;nbsp;readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opportunities&lt;/em&gt;: [&amp;#8230;] Additional opportunities exist to engage potential job providers and skill developers as CNCS partners and to advocate for the growing role of technology in employment and&amp;nbsp;education.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this stakeholder feedback will be integrated into CNCS&amp;#8217;s strategic plan at an actionable level remains to be&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One place for optimism in the strategy brief is the strategy to &amp;#8220;Embed service-based approaches with federal peers and partners that align with CNCS&amp;nbsp;priorities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This strategy leverages CNCS&amp;#8217; national leadership role and potential to catalyze efforts that feature service-based solutions to pressing needs. For example, given our priorities in education, health, economic opportunity, the environment, military families and veterans and disaster services we will seek, and create where necessary, opportunities to partner and collaborate with other federal agencies and organizations. Specifically, we will prioritize those opportunities where national service combined with the capabilities and resources of our partners&amp;#8217; yields stronger, sustainable and scalable&amp;nbsp;results.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC&amp;#8217;s National Broadband Plan recommends just such a partnership between CNCS and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)&amp;#8212;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadband.gov/plan/9-adoption-and-utilization/#s9-3&quot;&gt;Recommendation 9.3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;in the creation of a Digital Literacy Corps. Time will tell whether CNCS or NTIA will have the capacity to develop such a large-scale&amp;nbsp;partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the opportunity for federal-level partnership, much of CNCS&amp;#8217;s resources are aimed at generating local non-profit partnerships. Without a specific focus on technology or media in CNCS&amp;#8217;s strategic goals many innovative technology and media projects&amp;#8212;and the individuals and communities they support&amp;#8212;will not benefit from CNCS&amp;#8217;s capacity-building service&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>More on learning from mistakes</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/2/more-on-learning-from-mistakes</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;No one is immune to making mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;
And I have to express admiration to those who will admit it, learn from it, and make the changes necessary to respond to it.&lt;br /&gt;
But to make mistakes and changes at such a high level and talk about it, well, that&amp;#8217;s like superhero stuff to me.&lt;br /&gt;
Take this week&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/14/AR2010021403550.html&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; from the White&amp;nbsp;House:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
White House officials are retooling the administration&amp;#8217;s communications strategy to produce faster responses to political adversaries, a more disciplined focus on President Obama&amp;#8217;s call for &amp;#8220;change&amp;#8221; in Washington and an increasingly selective use of the president&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messaging adjustments are the result of an end-of-the-year analysis in which White House advisers said the president&amp;#8217;s communications team had not taken the initiative often enough and had allowed drawn-out debates in Congress, and relentless criticism by Republicans, to drown out his&amp;nbsp;message.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it&amp;#8217;s a political move.  But what do any of us do for our organizations that isn&amp;#8217;t, in essence, a political move to build support and resources for us to do our work better?  We constantly hone our messages, revise our plans, and change our methods.&lt;br /&gt;
If we keep our eye on the long view, know why we do what we do, and admit why we&amp;#8217;re doing it, we can build movements built on trust and openness.&lt;br /&gt;
Administration, I say to you: Keep on&amp;nbsp;learning. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Broadband Adoption Accelerators</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/2/broadband-adoption-accelerators</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been taking time to digest the The Broadband Coalition&amp;#8217;s report on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jointcenter.org/publications_recent_publications/media_and_technology/expanding_and_accelerating_the_adoption_use_of_broadband_throughout_the_economy&quot;&gt;Expanding and Accelerating the Adoption &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Use of Broadband Throughout the Economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. What I appreciate most about the report is the systemic approach it takes: leveraging existing community infrastructure, programs and organizations while expanding their capacity to include broadband adoption and&amp;nbsp;use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the approach and recommendations from this report could quite easily be adapted to other media access and literacy&amp;nbsp;campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report defines Broadband accelerators as programs&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
•	Promote and assist affordable home computer and Internet access.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Are embedded in established community social and institutional networks.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Are “High-touch” – based on personal interactions and relationships.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Provide continuing formal as well as peer support to the new adopter through several critical stages of the “adoption curve”: engage, train, equip and support.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Integrate basic broadband adoption with other strongly motivating opportunities, e.g. employment, education, public safety, healthcare needs, civic and neighborhood&amp;nbsp;improvement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach can be well-informed by the Community Technology Centers movement: while many centers were founded on offering &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; training, they evolved into &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; centers specializing in employment, education, etc. Broadband adoption, like computer literacy before it, is a means, not an&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resource these changes, the report makes some key policy recommendations at each level of&amp;nbsp;government:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At a national level, foster evergreen funding sources to support community efforts needed to help nonsubscribers become confident and effective technology&amp;nbsp;users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage states to adopt policies and strategies that facilitate and support the building of community-based broadband access and adoption&amp;nbsp;programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage local initiatives and local funding to support community-based broadband access and adoption&amp;nbsp;programs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 <title>Technology Development is Organizational Development</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/1/technology-development-is-organizational-development</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aspirationtech.org/publications/manifesto&quot;&gt;Aspiration Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Technology challenges are organizational development challenges in disguise.&lt;/strong&gt; Designing and redesigning web sites, developing online communications strategies, deciding who gets to blog, Tweet, and update social network status: these objectives tease out underlying issues of how an organization represents its work, talks about itself, and empowers its staff and allies to convey the same. Technology projects too often go awry not because of tech issues, but because an organization is not prepared to address the foundational dynamics that underpin effective technology utilization. Organizations should be prepared to do heavy lifting in challenging existing process (and/or the lack thereof) and associated control dynamics, and should treat technology engagements as opportunities to move to more transparent and accountable ways of doing business, communicating and affecting social&amp;nbsp;change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much, much more,&amp;nbsp;including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology without process is bad&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What has worked offline for generations still deeply informs what works best&amp;nbsp;overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonprofits should never forget who technology leaves out, and what it leaves&amp;nbsp;undone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 <title>Creating Strategic Diversity</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2009/6/creating-strategic-diversity</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Diversity is one of the core values that underly the Transmission Project, as well as throughout the not-for-profit world. Pulling from a different playbook, the following is from the Chief of Information for the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Navy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.navyleague.org/councils/rhumb_lines.php&quot;&gt;for naval officers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaders who embrace diversity and differing viewpoints and seek talent that embodies a broad range of life experiences ensure naval readiness today and&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Navy must reflect the face of the nation. Further, we want an officer corps that is reflective of the enlisted force it&amp;nbsp;leads.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obtaining talent from diverse populations across the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; strengthens the force and ensures forward&amp;nbsp;progress.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s good advice for us with a quick search and replace of nouns. And of course, if you feel military thinking doesn&amp;#8217;t apply to not-for-profits, just think about it next time you look at your &lt;em&gt;strategic&lt;/em&gt; plan, develop your social media &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt; and prepare for your capital &lt;em&gt;campaign&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this quote from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationdissemination.net/2009/06/diversity-guidance-i-can-believe-in.html&quot;&gt;Information Dissemination blog&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;#8220;The intersection of maritime strategy and strategic communications&amp;#8221;), and they have a pointed criticism that is also equally valid for nonprofits: diversity includes more than the factors involved between conception and 18 years old. If your staff all have similar work histories, or your leadership team all has similar management degrees, you haven&amp;#8217;t achieved what the naval context calls &lt;em&gt;command track diversity&lt;/em&gt;. Diverse professional histories are just as important as diverse personal&amp;nbsp;histories.&lt;/p&gt;
