                    <p>The College of Public and Community Service is one of five colleges that comprise the University of Massachusetts Boston campus. As such, CPCS seeks to extend the tradition of the land grant university in a number of&nbsp;ways:</p>
<p>Educating students to foster the public good and aid the transformation to a more equitable society<br />
Providing research, advocacy, technical assistance, and service to the surrounding community<br />
Forging partnerships with public agencies and community organizations that enhance the quality of life for low income and other inadequately served populations<br />
In these ways, the college works toward overcoming the attitudes, beliefs, and structures in our society which prevent access to the resources that exist and discourage full participation in economic, civic, cultural and political life. As an alternative educational institution, CPCS endeavors to function as an inclusive, democratic, and participatory learning community which promotes diversity, equality, and social&nbsp;justice.</p>
<p>CPCS actively cultivates a diverse and mature student body and offers an empowering and effective education which equips students to advocate for themselves and to improve the health and well-being of their chosen communities. The college recognizes that, particularly in a multicultural society, such an educational enterprise is inextricably bound to the complementary goals of meaningful access and adequate support for underserved populations. The successful CPCS graduate is a competent, confident, self-directed, life long learner who can&nbsp;demonstrate:</p>
<p>Language and technical skills necessary for purposeful inquiry and communication<br />
Professional competence to function effectively in a broad range of workplace and community-based roles and activities<br />
Critical consciousness needed to clarify and challenge prevailing values, ideologies, and practices<br />
Essential knowledge required for participating fully in&nbsp;society</p>
<p>The CPCS curriculum is designed with such students in mind. The core of this inventive educational system is an outcome-oriented curriculum in which prior learning is validated and collaborative projects are encouraged. At CPCS, the student is considered a resource in the educational process, and the acquisition of knowledge and skills intersects with experiential learning and field-based education. As a forward-looking educational institution, CPCS continues to explore innovative delivery systems and technologies and seeks to articulate its educational philosophy and pedagogy with other academic institutions, community organizations, and public&nbsp;agencies.</p>

This position provides an excellent environment in which to develop professional editorial skills in various media. This VISTA will serve as Assistant Editor of the Community Technology&nbsp;Review</p>
<p>As specified in this year&#8217;s project basics (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm</a>), all organizations participating in the VISTA Project will be required to do some work in one of four areas (community networking, community organizing, technology assistance to nonprofits, and digital media for youth). Nationally known experts will be coordinating each of these areas. The Curriculum Coordinator will work with these experts to develop curricular material to be used for people with interest these areas and for the College&#8217;s Community Media and Technology&nbsp;program.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>In her capacity as Assistant Editor of &#8220;The Community Technology Review&#8221; (<a href="http://www.comtechreview.org" title="www.comtechreview.org">www.comtechreview.org</a>), Danielle ably undertook a wide range of responsibilities including taking over the reins from the previous Associated Editor and completing all organizing and author communication already in the works, coordinating sections and writing a substantial number of articles for the fall issue.  She oversaw the development and production of the online version, dealt with university printing services in arranging for hard copy printings, and did author/contributor follow-up. Following this, she was helpfully involved in working with the Advisory Committee in undertaking future planning, and when the decision was made for the publication to go on hiatus and be replaced in the interim with the Project newsletter/report, she accepted oversight responsibility and published the first issue (see <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters</a>) in its entirety.  She has followed this up with taking primary responsbility for planning future issues for the remainder of the project year, including coordination with the Priority Area Coordinator materials, as that dovetails and integrates with her work with them in developing curricular material for the project that can be integrated with the College&#8217;s Community Media and Technology Program (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt</a>).  In addition to these things, she has proved to be a key and invaluable member of the project leadership team at office&nbsp;headquarters.</p>
<p>Danielle serves as liason between the Community Media and Technology Program curriculum building efforts and the VISTA project&#8217;s content focused learning groups. She has been extremely effective in working with faculty in curriculum design, making real connections between the field work of the VISTA&#8217;s and the CMT curriculum. She has also worked to assist me in the Tactical Media project, a project-based learning initiative of the program, in coordinating planning and research, presentations and communications flow for the project. She has also taken the leadership in creating and presenting a number of new media workshops, digital storytelling, for example. Along with her VISTA partner, she coordinated a digital media mini conference for students, faculty and staff.  Danielle has undertaken extensive curriculum research for a study on community media our program is doing in conjunction with the Benton Foundation, as well research for the development of future courses in the College of Public and Community service. Danielle has performed at a very high level of thoughtfulness and strategic insight. Danielle has made an enormous contribution to the CMT program&#8217;s&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>Danielle has quickly become an important part of the Project headquarters team. She has shown admirable persistence in her efforts to draw some useful &#8216;curriculum&#8217; from busy VISTAs and under-utilized &#8216;priority area coordinators.&#8217; I actually think that she has accomplished more in this area than she gives herself credit for&#8211; mostly through her exchanges with VISTAs in the field but also through her (and Shannon&#8217;s) efforts to get VISTAs involved in workshops and events related to the CMT program. She has in some sense become an unofficial VISTA leader through here extensive contact with VISTAs across the country. She has also done a good deal of evangelizing for the Project&#8211; a number of new organizations will be applying as a result of these efforts. She&#8217;s a gifted/natural-born communicator and that&#8217;s just so helpful in so many&nbsp;ways.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>VISTAs have not had an easy time keeping in touch with each other, both during and after service. In some cases certain personal information wasn&#8217;t even kept on file, such as a home telephone number. I created a global addressbook last year and incorporated it into the redesigned VISTA website this year. Alumni and current VISTAs now have a simple facility on the Project website to share their information as well as access other VISTAs&#8217; information. In enhancing VISTA alumni resources and communications the VISTA Leaders wrote a form letter to all past alumni announcing the creation of a new CTC VISTA alumni connections mailing list (January), which also served to connect alumni to the great CTC VISTA directory networking resource. We plan to use this addressbook to periodically send a newsletter to alumni and hold&nbsp;reunions.</p>
<p>Assistant Director Paul Hansen and I worked collaboratively to re-launch the VISTA website (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/" title="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/">http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/</a>), creating a mock-up on a development server before going live with the re-design. In addition to migrating the directory pages off the development server, I replaced the static roster listings (current VISTAs, alumni, all VISTAs, and organizations) with dynamic database- backed pages, laying the groundwork for a recruiting system in which potential supervisors can add and edit VISTA job descriptions directly on the website. (The rosters do not at present list who is a second- or third-year VISTA, and it does not indicate any special titles for people, like VISTA Leader, for&nbsp;example). </p>
<p>Developed enhanced VISTA resources. One of the biggest challenges any group of short-term workers faces is the loss of knowledge when the staff turns over. In an effort to combat the lack of knowledge retention between VISTA &#8220;classes,&#8221; Dan<br />
Schackman and I erected a resource wiki on the Project website. A wiki is &#8220;a website that allows users to add content, as on an Internet forum, but also allows anyone to edit the content&#8221; (WikiPedia.org). The wiki technology is widely deployed across the Internet and was chosen for its ability to cater to both novice and advanced Internet users. Dan and I created a modest framework though which VISTAs and non-VISTAs alike can contribute to and maintain a database of resources exclusively targeted to CTC VISTAs. Dan and I fleshed it out with resources provided by VISTAs David Johnson and Michelle Rogers. I feel the wiki will serve as an effective tool enabling VISTAS to have greater&nbsp;participation</p>
<p>The Community Technology Review website (<a href="http://www.comtechreview.org" title="www.comtechreview.org">www.comtechreview.org</a>) was beefed up and migrated from an obsolete web server to a server which hosts all other CPCS website properties (CPCS, VISTA, CBC, etc.). Of note are the new comment approval system and the PayPal order page. The comment page will ease the approval process for user-submitted comments, and the order page will streamline CTR hardcopy purchases which can now be handled with a credit card. I also trained Dan Schackman to use the administration interface and made some minor code changes for the Winter 2005&nbsp;issue. </p>
<p>Finally, I became savvy with Final Cut Pro and edited a couple of small VISTA project videos for distribution on the web (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/video/" title="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/video/">http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/video/</a>). I massaged the swearing in footage for the 2004-05 crop of VISTAs originally shot on September 1 by former VISTA Leader James Fishwick, featuring US Representative Barney Frank and UMass/Boston Chancellor Keith Motley. A couple more projects have been added to the archives, including a Liz Cavano’s half-hour &#8220;What&#8217;s a VISTA&#8221; (2001) and Scott Hillier’s “CTC VISTAs: A Day in the Life”&nbsp;(2003). </p>
<p>The past few months haven&#8217;t been spent exclusively glued to a keyboard and monitor. I spoke at Faneuil Hall in October on AmeriCorps Opening Day, an ambassador of the CTC VISTA Project. A number of situations arose with a few VISTAs, some of whom I tried to help with varying degrees of success. For my part I served as a liaison with a VISTA in Minnesota, who ended up leaving the program after transferring from her first assignment and failing to make her second assignment work; I supported two VISTAs in Massachusetts, one in California, and one in North Carolina  who had some conflicts with their supervisors and another experiencing some serious interpersonal conflicts with one of her co-workers. These situations have been very time and energy intensive, requiring frequent and detailed communication with VISTA support staff and the involved&nbsp;parties. </p>
<p>On a related front of Project responsibility, I assumed coordinating responsibilities for the monthly meetings among the Boston VISTAs, ensuring an agenda, chairperson, and minute-taker for every meeting as well as editing and posting the&nbsp;minutes</p>
<p>During the 05-06 project year, Saul&#8217;s supervisor said the following:<br />
Saul has continued to lend his considerable technical skills to a number of projects&#8211; some to the benefit of the college others to the benefit of the Project. The addition of the reporting system to the Project&#8217;s &#8216;online application system&#8217; has been an enormous help and was pulled-off pretty much without a hitch. Reports were submitted by participating organizations largely on-time! This was unheard of in the past and represents a huge leap forward in efficency. He continues to work on the application system. Currently he is revising it so that organizations can have and access more than one application&#8211; for multi-year projects. This revision is proceeding slowly however. In the role of VISTA Leader (and as the Leader of the other Leaders) Saul has performed well. Communication between the Leaders could be better (more frequent perhaps) but the improvement over previous years has been considerable largely due to his coordinating efforts which began well before the August 2005 PSO. Saul also plays a vital role as the person whom I bounce my ideas off of. As I often have bad ideas, the value of this cannot be&nbsp;underestimated.</p>

Over the course of his last six months, James continued to do very impressive work in all three areas and concluded his term of service by becoming the project&#8217;s VISTA Leader for a second year of service and attending VISTA Leader training at the end of&nbsp;August.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>James took on major responsibility for CBC coordination, project web site development, and the monthly pilot cable and web cast &#8220;First Tuesday&#8221; program, undertaking the latter while serving as the Assistant Producer.Overall project coordination involved assisting with monthly meeting arrangements and follow through with subcommittee needs and support.  Web site development included not only design and technical maintenance but content development as well. As Assistant Producer for &#8220;First Tuesday,&#8221; James undertook a wide range of tasks insuring smooth program production, including serving as live-time chat coordinator and on-camera contributor, set design, plant, and web cast coordination, and post-production&nbsp;assistance.</p>
<p>With regard to the College, James continued to provide a good range of support to individual faculty and programs and helped give visible, tangible testimony of the value of the Community Media and Technology program.  In addition to special help to five faculty/programs, James assisted the CPCS IT Task Force, a committee dedicated to a thorough review of the current IT landscape at UMass and its effect on the college. The task force makes recommendations to the college on how to move on various IT issues, especially the establishment and subsequent development of the Clark Taylor Center. James has served as secretary to the committee and has helped to facilitate discussions on needs for the Center with CPCS&nbsp;faculty.</p>
<p>Finally, as the web master for the CTC VISTA Project itself (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista</a>), James initiated a number of design and content contributions that have contributed to the project&#8217;s aesthetic and programmatic presentation for VISTAs, supervisors, and the general public.  His work with the VISTAs in encouraging and helping them develop their own web pages and resources, along with his moderation of the metroBoston and national CTC VISTA member electronic discussion lists and general communication have given him a major leadership status among his fellow VISTAs and in the overall&nbsp;project.</p>

<p>Melissa&#8217;s work in overseeing the project&#8217;s outreach and information pages on the Corporation for National Service&#8217;s information web site and dealing with prospective program VISTAs has been organized and efficient.  Through the late spring and summer, this extreme demands of this task involving communication not only with all VISTA applicants but with project supervisors can be appreciated by the fact that the CTC VISTA Project is the most popular in the entire CNS system.  A combination of work in both these arenas lead to a natural taking on of project-wide development work involving support for Project VISTAs in numerous arenas, the most visible of which were her work in producing a VISTA-focused project newsletter (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter</a>) and overseeing/coordinating the project&#8217;s joint VISTA-Supervisor Advisory Committee.  Along with her contributions to the monthly Boston-area VISTA meetings, serving on the &#8220;First Tuesday&#8221; television production team, filling the gaps and undertaking other initiatives for project support, Melissa&#8217;s leadership is generally recognized by both her peers and the project&nbsp;administration.</p>

<p>As Project Development Associate, Erin was instrumental in improving our outreach and communication. Erin developed a comprehensive plan for outreach to colleges and other media technology programs, significantly enlarging our pool of qualified VISTA applicants. Additionally, Erin&#8217;s research of organizational and institutional partners led us to having one of the most successful VISTA placement rounds ever, with more than 100 organizations submitting applications. On her work on The Digest, our organization&#8217;s newsletter and review, Erin worked closely with staff and VISTAs to produce four unique and high-quality&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>In addition to outreach work, Erin greatly improved our fundraising capacity. Erin researched more than 40 funding institutions, documenting her processes and providing a strong foundation for future development. She leaves many templates for proposals and grant language, and submitted many letters of introduction and one complete&nbsp;proposal. </p>
<p>Lastly, Erin has proved invaluable in her collaborations with other local VISTAs and VISTA Leaders. In addition to helping to bring about two successful Pre-Service Orientations and our monthly area meetings, Erin has greatly helped in encouraging discussion and creating collaborations between members and&nbsp;organizations.</p>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

“By concentrating on curriculum and training, Gariet made sure that the website would stay useful to the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program beyond just his year with&nbsp;us. </p>
<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
