 <title>140 Conference: Small Town</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/140-conference-small-town</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of the #140conf events, conferences have taken place in a number of BIG cities including: New York City, Los Angeles, London and Tel&amp;nbsp;Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At these events we have explored the effects of twitter on a wide range of topics including: Celebrity, “The Media”, Advertising, Politics, Fashion, Real Estate, Music, Education, Public Safety, Public Diplomacy and quite a few other topics. #140conf Small Town will be a ground breaking opportunity to look at the effects of the real-time web on the people and the businesses inside of and around Small Towns. I thank Becky McCray for being the inspiration behind this event and for her help and leadership in making this event&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you define “small&amp;nbsp;town”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could set a dividing line of population, we aren’t going to. We mean to include small towns and rural areas, outlying suburbs and exurbs. Plus, plenty of people who live in a big city have some important small town connection, whether that’s where you grew up, where you plan to move, where your parents came from, or where your clients&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about small towns and want to be part of the discussion, we want you to join&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
