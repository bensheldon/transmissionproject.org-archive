                    <p>This year has been successful, for we conducted the following classes here at the Riley Hill Technology Center:  Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, as well as Introduction to the personal computer. The total number of students attending was 54. As Ella says, “I was blessed with seven volunteer instructors by advertising in the community. I was also privileged to teach Microsoft Word with an Introduction to the Personal&nbsp;Computer.”</p>
<p>A Computer Repair course was developed for Riley Hill Community Technology Center. Ella decided to use two resources to develop this course: Computer Concepts (Third Edition) and Technology for Social Change&#8217;s curriculum (<a href="http://www.tecschange.org" title="www.tecschange.org">www.tecschange.org</a>) with their permission. Ella also planned to use the RTPnet site as a reference for this&nbsp;course.</p>

                    <p>Developing this course has helped Ella to better troubleshoot computers, for there are individuals in the community that are in dire need of help.  These individuals bring their personal computers to the center for technical support. In the Wendell Community and surrounding areas, the Riley Hill Technology Center is the only source that does not charge a fee for&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>We very grateful to add our source of Volunteers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Technology Resources. We have used the following sources this year&nbsp;(2003-2004):</p>
<p>•	Schools (K-12) students as well as other personnel<br />
•	Community Colleges<br />
•	Libraries (Public and Other)<br />
•	Local businesses<br />
•	Wake Forest Pediatrics (Wake Forest, NC)<br />
•	Churches (Wakefield, Zebulon First Baptist etc.)<br />
•	RTP.net (Website)<br />
•	Family and Friends of staff members<br />
•	Department of Social Services (Eastern Regional Center, Zebulon)<br />
•	Retired Senior&nbsp;citizens</p>
<p>The quality of life has improved for the youth and adults who have taken computer classes at the center, however updating the computer equipment as well as software is still needed. We are currently looking for funding for this project and for a long-term way of sustaining the center.  The Riley Hill Survey Plan has given some insight on how to get this plan&nbsp;implemented.</p>

She is very dependable, very cooperative, a team player, and continues to be an asset to the Riley Hill Community. Her interaction with others (peers, youth, students, etc.) is outstanding. During this time period, there have not been any negative comments received regarding Ella. To sum it up, I would rate her as &#8216;Consistently Exceeds&#8217; the requirements in all aspects of the job.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>Brenda Jackson began her work as a VISTA volunteer with PLUK in June of 2002. Her principal goal has been to further develop the technology center programs, outreach to other community organizations and sustainability. We’ve come a long way and then some with Brenda’s assistance.  The centerpiece has been funding for a state-wide tutoring program for at-risk children which is headquartered within the technology center. Brenda was a participant in an eight-month program for training collaborative teams around the state to evaluate technology needs for individuals with disabilities. We continue to benefit from her efforts by being awarded a Beaumont Foundation Grant she had written for a mobile lab to be used for&nbsp;training.</p>

                    <p>In specific terms: in respect to Goal #1, we have in fact created a contextualized literacy program in response to the previously assessed needs of the A+ candidates.  In conjunction with the curriculum we have produced the necessary adjoining workbook. At this time we have just completed our first test run of this curriculum, we are currently gathering and analyzing the feedback from subjects along with our partnering organizations.  To date the response has been overwhelmingly positive.  We are now moving to incorporate this data into the program&nbsp;itself.  </p>
<p>As to Goal #2 the materials are currently under review by the AACC.  We are expecting helpful feedback and an overall smooth process. At this point in time the curriculum remains under advisement with the&nbsp;AACC.</p>
<p>On Goal #3 we have created and put in place specific operating agreements with our various partner organizations.  As these agreements were drafted by a VISTA who is a lawyer, they are professionally created and agreed upon by all&nbsp;concerned.</p>

                    <p>AmeriCorps/ VISTA member Heidi Marshall finished development work on the C-CAN Volunteer Hub project as well as work on a new initiative: developing a “technical assessment” report that local CTCs might use as a&nbsp;model.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Hub project required finalizing the database of local CTCs, contracting them to review their data, and training them in use of the online volunteer database and volunteer opportunities directory (<a href="http://www.c-can.org" title="www.c-can.org">www.c-can.org</a>). In the course of this project, Heidi focused on recruitment of volunteers. To date, volunteers have been matched to 12 programs around the city, and several more are scheduled to come on board this coming fall of&nbsp;2003.</p>

                    <p>In addition to recruiting and managing volunteers, Heidi has been very involved with local colleges and the University of Minnesota regarding placement of student interns within area CTCs. Heidi attended many meetings in the course of this project, and as a result, C-CAN was one of only a few, select non-profit organizations the U of Minnesota chose as partners for their community outreach program, a program that places undergraduates in social service agencies as part of course&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>This groundwork has helped us to develop a sustainable network of volunteers for local CTCs that will serve the community even after our AmeriCorps*VISTA members finish their service later this&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>Since February of 2003, Heidi has organized and facilitated two quarterly and one annual meeting for local CTCs, working with other national organizations to provide resources to our local CTC partners. As a result of her outreach work, 25 local CTC leaders and advocates, and a representative from CTC/national (Felicia Sullivan) made a presentation at our annual conference in&nbsp;September. </p>
<p>Heidi finished work with a local community agency (Pillsbury United Communities; see attached) to develop and implement a “technical assessment” project that will serve as a model for other organizations that have asked for assistance with&nbsp;assessments.</p>

                    <p>As an Americorps*Vista with Technology For All, Ken Yu has been involved in capacity building with TFA’s Mission Milby Community Technology Center (MMCTC). Ken’s involvement has centered on the development of a full complement of CTC activities and programs in service to the community. One significant accomplishment that Ken had direct leadership responsibility for was the implementation of the tax assistance program at MMCTC. He also has been instrumental in organizing and starting new class offerings including a basic computer skills class in Spanish. During the month of February, MMCTC had 382 unique individuals participate in CTC programs and&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>A key component of the Americorps*Vista project with TFA has been capacity building.	 Building good relationships with community members and clients of the CTC is an important part of this. He has developed several strong working relationships with a few clients. Another component of capacity building is the development of community volunteers to support the work of the CTC. Recently, Ken recruited a Spanish speaking community member to lead a new basic computer skills class in Spanish. This was a big accomplishment for the CTC and for&nbsp;Ken.</p>
<p>One of Ken’s capacity building activities has been the development and implementation of CTC data collection and entry. We are now able to compare CTC data for each month regarding class sessions and attendance within the CTC. Ken’s responsibility for this activity will help us with funders as we seek additional support for our work in the&nbsp;community.</p>
