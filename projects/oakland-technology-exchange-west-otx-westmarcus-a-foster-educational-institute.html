                    <p>The Marcus A. Foster Educational Institute (MAFEI) Oakland Technology Exchange West project (OTX-W) is a large-scale computer reuse program dedicated to providing high quality, refurbished home computers to families, students and teachers.  As reflected in the scope of work and subsequent MOU agreement, MAFEI continues to meet the following objectives for FY&nbsp;2004-05.</p>
<p>OTX-West is dedicated to eliminating the digital divide in Oakland, California. We do this by refurbishing surplus computers, educating families and providing ongoing access and support to those who have received our computers. The experiences of OTX-West over the past 6 years has demonstrated both the need for home computers in the community and the reuse model as a green way to meet the&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, everyone needs access to computers and the Internet in order to join the new economy. Access to education, health care, government agencies, jobs, and other services are all currently offered through the Internet. This need has many adults feeling like they are too old to learn the tools of the &#8220;information age.&#8221; This way of thinking, along with the lack of resources in the communities, contributes to the &#8220;digital divide&#8221; that exits in&nbsp;Oakland.</p>
<p>It is not enough to provide computers, although this is essential. OTX-West provides education that is necessary for those who are getting their computers for the first time. Technical support is also necessary to keep these computers working properly so that the people of Oakland can continue to learn and become a part of the &#8220;information age&#8221; and not be left&nbsp;behind.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Naomi&#8217;s responsibilities were many and varied. At the beginning of the year, she assisted in the major redesign of our website, <a href="http://www.otxwest.org" title="www.otxwest.org">www.otxwest.org</a>. Using tools such as Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and others, she added to visual elements as well as rewrote a significant amount of the content and reworked the navigation. Her technical duties consisted of helping to coordinate the installation of labs in schools and community centers. She worked with our network specialists to set up and occasionally maintain labs both in in schools and at community centers in various locations around Oakland. In addition, she often participated in our Tech Support Day, which is the day when recipients of our refurbished computers can come in and have their computers repaired or receive one-on-one instruction. She also assisted in the instruction of both our Take Home Computer Program, as well as four digital storytelling workshops, which varied in length from 2 days to four weeks. She would also occasionally supervise our&nbsp;volunteers.</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Naomi enhanced the existing curriculum for our Take Home Computer Program curriculum, adding about 10 additional pages to our training manual, which covers basic computer maintenance and internet safety. She also created various instructional handouts for our digital storytelling classes. She was directly responsible for an increase in the attendance of our Take Home Computer Program by at least 300 students, which is roughly one third more than last year. She also helped upwards of 270 students become confident in the use of multimedia software during our digital storytelling classes. She also increased her technology skills, both software and hardware. She went from having little to no experience using audio and image editing software, to being knowledgeable enough to teach others how to use them. She went from being slightly nervous speaking in front of a group, to being a commanding and effective presence in the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
<p>Although it isn&#8217;t particularly specific, Naomi&#8217;s digital story &#8220;California Dreaming&#8221; inspired many students to learn to use the multimedia programs. It never failed to get applause when we played it in&nbsp;class.</p>

<p>Jeff has also attended a KQED workshop on digital story telling and is working with Domingo Vaszuez, a multimedia professional, to finalize the curriculum for our upcoming digital story telling pilot workshop.  The workshop has been scheduled, 20 students have been selected, and all is a go for the week of Spring Break, April&nbsp;10-14.</p>
<p>We are currently working with project SOAR to schedule 200-300 7th graders into our summer technology workshop.  This one week workshop, for 6 separate sessions, will run from June 26 to August 4.  We will be updating our first classroom to also accomodate the students.  The curriculum we will use will be that piloted in April.  Jeff is involved in every detail of this large, (and new to us)&nbsp;endeavor.</p>

Through OTX we serve a school district population comprised of 48,000 students and 104 school sites.  For the purpose of the home computer component of OTX-West’s computer reuse program, Clarice assisted in the coordination of this effort to reach 41 middle school and high school sites.  Her work included creating and organizing information packets, scheduling meetings with school sites and staffing orientations.  Due to the extensive outreach effort, we were able to serve 800 middle school and high school students last&nbsp;Fall.</p>
<p>MAFEI currently has six interns representing the traditional high schools in the District, two of whom have returned from the previous year.  As an Americorps member, Clarice serves as a liaison with OTX interns, coordinating work schedules and advising them appropriately regarding work&nbsp;responsibilities.</p>

<p>Ian Bauer worked with staff and the project consultant funded by CTCNET/ATA to assess the current capacity and need for volunteers.  Ian assisted in the development of the volunteer training manual; streamlining the process for coordinating assignments for weekly “Volunteer Days” and “Distribution&nbsp;Days.”</p>
<p>As MAFEI successfully completed the training manual within the projected three-month time period, Ian coordinated the weekly management of both student and adult volunteers who had received computers from OTX-West. To date, approximately 500 student and adults have volunteered at OTX-West including IT students from local vocational programs, high school and middle school students with varying interests in computer&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Ian coordinated interns’ weekly tasks—preparing computer labs for trainings, assembling training materials, staffing distribution days.  Ian is currently developing a training model whereby interns will be able to successfully conduct computer training courses, having become proficient in basic computer software applications and increased their knowledge of computer equipment and basic hardware&nbsp;operations.</p>

<p>MAFEI significantly benefited from Ian’s expertise and interest in website design.  Ian increased his responsibilities in this area by successfully upgrading the organization’s website(s) <a href="http://www.mafei.org" title="www.mafei.org">www.mafei.org</a> and <a href="http://www.otxwest.org" title="www.otxwest.org">www.otxwest.org</a>,&nbsp;including:</p>
<p>• Reformatting website graphics,<br />
• Updating and adding to website text for OTX-West offerings, including technical support information and computer class training on-line registration<br />
• Creating links<br />
• Providing easier navigation of&nbsp;website</p>
<p>Learning Without Boundaries Literacy&nbsp;Initiative</p>
<p>Ian contributed significantly to the development of this project.  His role was central and continues to be a vital part of the continuance of this model.  A portion of his responsibilities&nbsp;included:</p>
<p>• Researching software writing&nbsp;programs;</p>
<p>• Conducting assessments and creating computer labs in the classroom of 3rd grade teachers participating in this&nbsp;project.  </p>
<p>• Developing a training manual for parents and students, integrating key components of the writing software program and Internet research.  Students learned how to research topics, find the definition of words and phrases and successfully complete a creative writing assignment (training guide&nbsp;available).</p>
<p>• Conducting computer training classes for third grade students and their&nbsp;families.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Among Ian’s talents and strengths are his ability to quickly identify and resolve problems.  As much of this project requires work in diverse communities with limited experience with computer technology,  Ian exhibited tremendous patience and support for these families.  MAFEI equally appreciated his ability to remain flexible in a changing work environment and meet each task with a great enthusiasm and a keen sense of humor.   He was certainly a welcomed addition to our staff.<br />

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

“By concentrating on curriculum and training, Gariet made sure that the website would stay useful to the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program beyond just his year with&nbsp;us. </p>
<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
