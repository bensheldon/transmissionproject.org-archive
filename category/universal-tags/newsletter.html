                    <p>This project would involve an update of SoFAB&#8217;s website. This would include the integration of the e-commerce site, blog, twitter and Facebook components, the newsletter, developing the e-zine, collections, and the wiki of Southern Food. This would make the marketing of SoFAB more modern and direct. It would mean that we will reach more members of the community who can become involved with SoFAB and its&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>The VISTA member would be helping SoFAB &#8220;catch up&#8221; and would train the appropriate staff to maintain and continue to update the technical capacity of the organization. In-person training, as well as a training manual, would be a legacy that would build the capacity of the&nbsp;organization.</p>
<p>- Work with the webmaster and various appropriate staff members to implement the technology necessary to achieve the goals of integration, improved content and improved marketing.<br />
- Make recommendations and suggestions to the staff, based on the volunteer&#8217;s observations, skill and&nbsp;experience.</p>

                    <p>First, because of her willingness to become a part of the organization, and secondly, because of her knowledge and understanding of the technology, Kelsey became integral to our planning process, helping us to make choices and actually use the advances in technology in new ways. She dragged us into thinking in new ways about what we were doing, so that now our entire culture has changed into being not only more modern, more attuned to technology, but also in now thinking to include new technologies in all of our projects and in our actions. This was a major cultural shift, accomplished by the example and encouragement of our VISTA&nbsp;member.</p>
<p>1. An update of SoFAB’s website, including the integration of the e-commerce site and blog. This goal was completely accomplished, except that we have merely archived the old blog and have begun to use our Facebook account instead.<br />
2. Twitter and Facebook components were established.<br />
3. The newsletter, developing the e-zine, collections, and the wiki of Southern Food have all been advanced.<br />
4. Our website was entirely redesigned and completely updated and reorganized. Our VISTA member was the primary person behind all of this, assisted by summer interns and other&nbsp;volunteers.</p>

                    <p>Colleen has been extremely important to our organization and has spent the past year on a variety of projects that help us to better communicate and collaborate internally and externally. She made upgrades to our CaliforniaVoices.org website and she also upgraded CMCWEB.org to a newer version of Joomla. She designed and implemented a new contact database, created a social media strategy (includes facebook, twitter, and more), and researched a number of open source software solutions for our&nbsp;organization.</p>
<p>She will continue to work out of our Sacramento office to increase the capacity of our organization to communicate, collaborate, and share best practices between our two regional&nbsp;offices.</p>
<p>The VISTA will research and develop the following internal systems:<br />
- build the capacity of the CMC Sacramento office to communicate/collaborate with the CMC Fresno office and implement CMC programs in Sacramento community.<br />
- Create hiring and training materials for new staff<br />
- Create standardized premiere planning materials<br />
- Create standardized systems for management training and staff supervision at the regional office level<br />
- Create standardized instructor training workshops<br />
- Create standardized electronic communication systems between offices<br />
- Create standardized staff trainings and guidelines for working with youth<br />
- Create material supplementing the California Voices training manual, focusing on higher-level filmmaking techniques<br />
- Create standardized film distribution resource lists, including social media avenues, film festivals, and community radio/TV&nbsp;avenues</p>

                    <p>This VISTA member, in their capacity as outreach assistant, would serve to bring new organizations and communities in to work with QUQ. The role of outreach assistant would be valuable experience for the VISTA member in networking, community organizing and learning about the community that she/he would be working and living in. It involves calling people, talking to them, sending them information by email, asking them to come to a meeting and to tour our&nbsp;studios.</p>
<p>The VISTA member would keep accurate records of contacts and the process of recruitment, as well as the steps and the results of fundraising efforts. These records would be used for the manual that would be developed in conjunction with the executive&nbsp;director.</p>

                    <p>Some main areas that Erica helped to develop and expand are: Volunteer recruitment/outreach, Partnership Expansion/Outreach, and Fundraising&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>Volunteer outreach: Erica has set up an entire program of recruitment of volunteers. As a result we had as many as 19 volunteer interns at one time at our facility during the fall, spring and summer months. The recruitment efforts targeted local universities and high schools. The success was due to setting up face to face meetings as well as using Craig&#8217;s List, social media and e-newsletter contact. This was done in conjunction with the Executive&nbsp;Director. </p>
<p>Partnership Outreach: Erica also worked on setting up partnerships with the Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau, Media Literacy Project, The Alibi (local weekly newspaper), Enlace Comunitario, SWOP, KUNM Youth Radio, Albuquerque Film Festival, SW Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Taos Shortz Film Festival, Experimental Cinema Film Festival, New Mexico Daily Lobo, Public Service Media Project, NM Film Office, NM Thunderbirds, CitizenSchools, and the creation of an accredited production class through the University of New Mexico Continuing Education&nbsp;department. </p>
<p>Fundraising Outreach: Erica worked on many small scale and large scale fundraising efforts throughout the year. Some examples of these efforts are: &#8220;Benefit Night&#8221; fundraisers being help at T.G.I.Friday and Fuddruckers, a &#8220;TV Dinner&#8221; benefit event, a concert event at a local venue, and the development of a monthly media industry networking event held at a local restaurant. Other areas have included working alongside the Executive Director on research for and preparation of grants and foundation money. Examples of this assistance was the working on a letter of inquiry for the Glaser Foundation which focused on Independent Media projects. We pitched the creation of a youth-focused journalism and mentorship program. A letter of inquiry into the MacArthur Foundation, regarding the same project. The creation of a profile in multiple local community foundations. She did extensive research and compiling together of regional, state-wide, and national grants and foundations that could be potential sources for income. Erica also helped Steve Ranieri with researching and preparing the application for a grant through the McCune Foundation, a local foundation here in New&nbsp;Mexico. </p>
<p>Other general outreach efforts that Erica engaged in were attending various local outreach events, such as: NM Film and Media Day, Digital Arts Conference, NM Film conference, SW Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Fiery Foods Show, and other events where the positive image of our organization was represented. All of these efforts were tracked, documented, and written into a manual titled &#8220;How to Outreach: a Resource Guide for Quote Unquote.&#8221; This resource will be left behind for future staff and VISTAs to refer back to for&nbsp;guidance.</p>
<p>Two other projects Erica worked on were the transitioning of the paper newsletter to the electronic newsletter and the transitioning of the Dreamweaver based website to a user-friendly, more efficient website through the Grassroots.org services. It developed through the need of better organizational efficiency. There was an indication that some staff had additional responsibilities that were taking them away from their actual work. With Erica noticing this, she suggested making these two main transitions as a means to alleviate extra work from staff (printing of newsletters, mailing them, updating the website using software that requires skills) and to build a more sustainable&nbsp;infrastructure.</p>

It also entails creating communications tools, such as a regular and targeted donor appeal, for soliciting a broad base of financial support from those that access our&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>Goal 1: Help build and solidify Prometheus&#8217; ability to engage community radio stations and community radio supporters in opportunities to support Prometheus financially and in a regular and sustainable&nbsp;fashion.</p>
<p>Goal 2: Create a more sustainable source of funding by developing technical services and products that Prometheus can offer for a&nbsp;fee.</p>

                    <p>Ian’s work as been essential at building the capacity of the organization at a key time of growth and transformation of&nbsp;Prometheus. </p>
<p>Towards goal #1 of increasing regular, constituent contact, Ian has: shepherded the development of a new database merging 4 into one, developed a system for maintenance, trained all staff, coordinated a monthly eNewsletter, coordinated an annual mail appeal, implemented CiviEvent for pre-registration for events, and implemented a paper sign up sheet system for events. As a result, our database list grew by 7,456 new contacts, including over 600 from the US Social Forum where Ian’s sign up system was first used. We now have over 1000 facebook fans who receive regular updates thanks to Ian’s merging of our email, web, and facebook communications. A database consultant worked with Ian to build the CiviCRM database after which he largely implemented the above with input from Prometheus collective&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>Towards goal #2 of building grassroots fundraising support, Ian has helped develop a work plan and donation calendar for the Development Team which has guided our work throughout the year and made reporting on progress much easier. He designed and launched our new Sustaining Funders program. He also designed and launched out new major donor program by identifying potential donors and inviting them to key events and creating a donor packet. Ian assisted in writing a number of grants and grant reports for Prometheus, helping to gather statistics on the effectiveness of our programs and the demographics of our constituents. He did these in conjunction with our Development&nbsp;Director. </p>
<p>Towards goal #3 of developing web donor tools, Ian has built a number of custom donation interfaces to our new database and build contact and other forms on our website. As a result, the new website will integrate seamlessly with our database, cutting out costly duplication of data. We can now track what appeal or route online donations come from and better assess the success of our specific fundraising efforts. Ian was trained by our web developer to create these&nbsp;forms.</p>

                    <p>In her capacity as Assistant Editor of &#8220;The Community Technology Review&#8221; (<a href="http://www.comtechreview.org" title="www.comtechreview.org">www.comtechreview.org</a>), Danielle ably undertook a wide range of responsibilities including taking over the reins from the previous Associated Editor and completing all organizing and author communication already in the works, coordinating sections and writing a substantial number of articles for the fall issue.  She oversaw the development and production of the online version, dealt with university printing services in arranging for hard copy printings, and did author/contributor follow-up. Following this, she was helpfully involved in working with the Advisory Committee in undertaking future planning, and when the decision was made for the publication to go on hiatus and be replaced in the interim with the Project newsletter/report, she accepted oversight responsibility and published the first issue (see <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters</a>) in its entirety.  She has followed this up with taking primary responsbility for planning future issues for the remainder of the project year, including coordination with the Priority Area Coordinator materials, as that dovetails and integrates with her work with them in developing curricular material for the project that can be integrated with the College&#8217;s Community Media and Technology Program (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt</a>).  In addition to these things, she has proved to be a key and invaluable member of the project leadership team at office&nbsp;headquarters.</p>
<p>Danielle serves as liason between the Community Media and Technology Program curriculum building efforts and the VISTA project&#8217;s content focused learning groups. She has been extremely effective in working with faculty in curriculum design, making real connections between the field work of the VISTA&#8217;s and the CMT curriculum. She has also worked to assist me in the Tactical Media project, a project-based learning initiative of the program, in coordinating planning and research, presentations and communications flow for the project. She has also taken the leadership in creating and presenting a number of new media workshops, digital storytelling, for example. Along with her VISTA partner, she coordinated a digital media mini conference for students, faculty and staff.  Danielle has undertaken extensive curriculum research for a study on community media our program is doing in conjunction with the Benton Foundation, as well research for the development of future courses in the College of Public and Community service. Danielle has performed at a very high level of thoughtfulness and strategic insight. Danielle has made an enormous contribution to the CMT program&#8217;s&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>Danielle has quickly become an important part of the Project headquarters team. She has shown admirable persistence in her efforts to draw some useful &#8216;curriculum&#8217; from busy VISTAs and under-utilized &#8216;priority area coordinators.&#8217; I actually think that she has accomplished more in this area than she gives herself credit for&#8211; mostly through her exchanges with VISTAs in the field but also through her (and Shannon&#8217;s) efforts to get VISTAs involved in workshops and events related to the CMT program. She has in some sense become an unofficial VISTA leader through here extensive contact with VISTAs across the country. She has also done a good deal of evangelizing for the Project&#8211; a number of new organizations will be applying as a result of these efforts. She&#8217;s a gifted/natural-born communicator and that&#8217;s just so helpful in so many&nbsp;ways.</p>

                    <p>Overall, Jenny has been a positive force for the lab. Everyone (staff) thought the effort was a success. Jenny was the first dedicated person for the computer lab, which was a huge step forward. Specifically, she continued working with the weekend Passport youth, and did more one-on-one training with preschool staff. The passport is a free access program for low-income Chinatown residents on Saturdays. Jenny also helped implement the&nbsp;E-newsletter.</p>
<p>Jenny completed the first newsletter, built relationships with Saturday Passport youth, collected resources, and worked on the first MIT Astronomy&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>Alli, working as a VISTA volunteer, has filled a huge void for BNN by assisting in promotions and outreach to the community. Through her first six months at BNN she has assisted not only the organization, but BNN producers in getting their message&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>In Alli&#8217;s second year at BNN she held the position of Youth Media Coordinator. Her duties included organizing a teen media club and producing a monthly program with the teens in the&nbsp;club.</p>

                    <p>She is currently helping to organize, write, and format BNN’s quarterly newsletter, our most important piece of literature sent to our members.  The newsletter introduces new equipment in our facilities, editing and production tips, and production class schedules. BNN has been unable to produce a newsletter since last winter, due to lack of staff and time, so Alli’s assistance in this is especially crucial.  Once the newsletter is completed it will be mailed to approximately 500 members and BNN typically receives a positive response from a large number of&nbsp;recipients. </p>
<p>Another example of Alli’s reach to the community is BNN’s Neighborhood Network News Program Highlights which Alli has been in charge of for the past six months.  The Program Highlights require Alli to be in close contact to all of our producers and to contact various shows on a weekly basis.  The Highlights also require her to send out a bulk mailing each month encouraging producers to contact her and let her know about their show, so that BNN can assist them in reaching as many people in the community as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Not only is Alli reaching out to community members, but during the next six months a lot of her attention will go to reaching out to community organizations. BNN provides non-profit organizations in the Greater Boston area a chance to produce a PSA highlighting their organization’s cause.  Alli will be responsible for the production and editing of these PSA’s, and she will assist BNN’s Education/Outreach department in contacting the organizations through phone calls, mailings and most importantly a “Get Your Message Out”&nbsp;seminar. </p>
<p>Over the last six months Alli has been a vital part in increasing BNN’s reach to the Boston community.  She has kept daily communication with many of our producers and the productions that she has assisted on have gotten her out into the community and aided BNN in delivering community&nbsp;messages.</p>
