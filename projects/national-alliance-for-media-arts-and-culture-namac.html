                    <p>For the 2009-2010 Online Community Management and Membership Engagement Plan we are looking for a a VISTA volunteer to:<br />
1. Manage and contribute to the 2009-10 Technology Infrastructure plan, which will continue to build the capacity of our members’ to connect and work with each other more fully.<br />
2. Work in collaboration with program staff to create new content and interactive areas of the NAMAC website; edit and post web content regularly to keep it fresh and relevant; maintain the website and its technical needs.<br />
3. Work with staff to set a social media strategy, and build out NAMAC’s capacity to reach members and the public through social media tools.<br />
4. Work with NAMAC staff to pilot a series of webinars on the use of social media tools.<br />
5. Expand and publish NAMAC’s web-based toolkits and guides to build capacity of our members’ organizations.<br />
6. Work with staff to engage and reach out to members by communicating with them regularly through social media platforms; and develop metrics for NAMAC-based website and social networking&nbsp;usage.</p>
<p>NAMAC’s 300 member organizations serve the needs of low income communities around the country by providing access to technologies in community media centers, teaching members from these communities digital literacies and instructing at-risk youth in media production technologies; broadcasting with and distributing to underserved populations (such as new immigrants); and advocating on behalf of low-income communities in the telecommunications policy area. Many of our member organizations provide technology workforce development programs. Because we are a national organization, we estimate that more than 5 million people people will be affected by the work that we and our members create and take part in; from more that 400,000 media professionals to audiences and media users numbering in the&nbsp;millions.</p>
<p>This project will strengthen both our capacity to deliver services to our member organizations and simultaneously encourage them to share knowledge and best practices among themselves by connecting them, encouraging collaboration, and disseminating content and analyses through social media tools and technologies. Now, more than ever, it is critical to build strong community ties among disparate members found at all points around the country – from small startups to venerable institutions. NAMAC brings them together to create a media democracy and commons open to&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>This project is both timely and necessary because it will build upon the work done by our first CTC VISTA staffer, Morgan Sully, who remodeled the NAMAC website in 2007-08, in its first iteration as an online community space. The next VISTA staffer will further develop our social networking capabilities, broadening and deepening our engagement with people through these interfaces. They are absolutely crucial to keep the organization lively and useful, and draw new members in. Social media is rapidly becoming a core demand that people want and need as part of a membership of a national network that seeks to bring organizations&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>NAMAC serves the media arts, and is extending its reach to offer services to the broader arts sector. We are here to ensure that our member organizations meet and work with their own communities through 21st century technologies. Our members expect us to provide a continuing stream of virtual connections, personal experiences and value-added knowledge. Online platforms now offer an advantageous way for NAMAC to reach, engage with and ask members to participate in our knowledge network. Social media platforms also give us a degree of customization, which means we can target programs and services to members in a specialized and targeted&nbsp;manner.</p>
<p>In addition, we plan to develop workshops and webinars that can also help members to productively use online social media to strengthen their real life engagement with their communities and&nbsp;supporters.</p>
<p>NAMAC has had a strong web-based presence since 1997, when we adopted a plan to offer a majority of our programs through our emerging knowledge network. It has grown and evolved through the years as tools and technologies have been refined. This next online phase is part of our strategic planning, and a way to deepen and broaden our relevancy to members, allies and supporters. And from our experience, we find that in order to be successful, the online community management must be undertaken by a real person who is there paying attention and responding continuously to the needs of the&nbsp;constituency.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Donna completed several significant web-based graphic design and technical projects during her assignment with NAMAC. She has significantly built the capacity of NAMAC’s online interactivity and resource-sharing to reach and assist members and the public around the country and&nbsp;globally.</p>
<p>Donna&#8217;s primary focus has been on developing the interactivity of the NAMAC website, in particular the Idea Exchange. This entails identifying which actions/networks are key for building our online presence and in building strong relationships with a team of bloggers who represent a cross-section of our online community, in terms of region, discipline, generation, and other important demographic&nbsp;criteria.</p>
<p>We have received increased traffic to our website, and conduct most of our membership business via the website: from conference and event registration to promotion and marketing, to resource-sharing, news and analysis across the field. The new look and architecture that Donna instituted has branded NAMAC as a leading web presence and has integrated well with our Facebook, Twitter and YouTube social media&nbsp;platforms.</p>

She gave the site a look that is striking and refined, and easy to work with by any new OCM. She worked out Drupal bugs, and brought Drupal developers in as consultants to upgrade the site to the current Drupal iteration. She interfaced with them throughout the changeover process. - Jack Walsh, VISTA&nbsp;Supervisor</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Morgan&#8217;s primary focus has been on the complete redesign of the NAMAC website &#8211; from complex technical programming to taxonomization of data and content to social networking and blogging. It launched in the end of August and is becoming the nervous system of the NAMAC offerings. We are very happy with the results and look forward to our next phase of community building online, educating our membership in social networking through the site, and extending its reach to other nonprofits, communities and the public. Morgan has been a kind, reponsive and patient staff member throughout this process, always thinking strategically about how our online offerings can benefit new members, communities and&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>Morgan wrote an article about the website-building process for our member newsletter and produced a short video on how to use the site to its maximum capability. Now he is transitioning into the role of online community manager. He is managing our website content, troubleshooting any technical problems, and most importantly creating an online community of dedicated users from the NAMAC membership and other nonprofits, to the public&nbsp;at-large.</p>
<p>It was a hard challenge to solve a lot of the technical problems that the transistion to a Drupal environment posed. But we were very pleased to see that not only was Morgan a problem solver, but he was a solution seeker, reaching out continuously to the technical community and his network of programmers to find ways to deal with the small to large issues that would&nbsp;arise.</p>

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

“By concentrating on curriculum and training, Gariet made sure that the website would stay useful to the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program beyond just his year with&nbsp;us. </p>
<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
