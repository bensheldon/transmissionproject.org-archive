                <span class="field-content"><p>Aaron has worked on a variety of fundraising, PR, and development projects. His main projects include: setting up a database to better organize our individual donor stewardship and cultivation campaign, working with corporate sponsors to secure technology equipment for UTEC&#8217;s new youth center, and instituting a new giving program for local&nbsp;corporations.</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Aaron has done a significant amount of work with these projects, securing donations of large scale pieces of equipment for UTEC as well as really streamlining the research, cataloging, and time line of our donor campaigns using online research tools and creating a database. He has also done some PR work designing materials for our corporate giving campaign. Additional projects include writing two grants and securing funding for our sports and recreation program. And updating and refining our donor mailing list which we use to send out newsletters, annual appeals, and other updates. He also worked to coordinate and publicize one fundraising event: an organ concert which drew over 60 people to the center, raised $500 and generated an enormous amount of local publicity for UTEC. We&#8217;ve had some challenges in focusing these projects in a way that priorities are clear so that deadlines will be met, as there is such a large number of projects to be covered in terms of the fund raising needs of the youth center. Aaron has done a great job of learning more organizational methods, and is putting them into practice in new ways that are really helping his&nbsp;work.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Aaron&#8217;s behind-the-scenes service to UTEC and the Lowell community has impacted young people&#8217;s lives and their access to resources, particularly technology in so many ways. Recently, Aaron contacted our donors and worked through their networks to secure donations and discounts of computer hardware. His work secured a deep discount of new model PCs and these will be purchased in the next few months. His hard work has ensured new technology for free teen use in our tech center. These young people typically do not have computers or internet access at home, so the addition of newer, faster computers to the tech center will ensure many more young people get access to the Internet each day for help with research, homework, job seeking and&nbsp;communication.</p>

This has helped staff better communicate with one another, and made accountability, reporting, and assigning tasks simpler and quicker, in order to better achieve our mission.   Jeff is making progress with his project to update the teen log-in database which will keep track of interactions of senior staff with all UTEC teen members.  Jeff has made a presentation and training manual on how to use the teen log-in database, and exchange servers.   Jeff has been working consistently with the CSL (on site once per week) to continue to enhance UTEC&#8217;s tecnhical capabilities.  Some of the projects he is working on in this regard are enhancing UTEC&#8217;s fundraising database, organizing the UTEC listserve, and his teen log-in database and exchange server projects.   Jeff is still preparing equipment to kick off the next wave of computer repair classes at UTEC, which will begin when UTEC officially opens our new building this&nbsp;spring.</p>

He has spent much focus on building systems (i.e. donor recognition systems) so that his work will last longer than his immediate 1-year impact. he produced our first ever annual report!!

He  took on a leading role in coordinating UTEC&#8217;s most comprehensive and successfull fundraiser to date. He has contributed immensely by helping us organize and develop a new online grants database (which I strongly believe will be a model for other nonprofits on how to best integrate technology into their development work). He has written and won grants.   He has created a well organized foundation/donor recognition system that has substantially improved our capacity for relationship building with funders. And he has provided much excitement around the development of a new individual donor organization process. I have been very pleased with Nathan&#8217;s work (this being his first time in a development position as this) and would rehire him in a&nbsp;minute.</p>

With our Dvelopment Director out sick for some time during this period, he was sometimes running this without a ton of support. He took this as a challenge and semed to be invigorated by the challenge&#8230; never pessimistic or overwhelmed by stress. In the end, we had nearly 200 guests attend and profited nearly $10,000. Moreover, all those who attended coninue today to talk about how professional and well orchestrated it was. Ultimately, Nathan was able to establish the inception of what will now be the annual fundraiser event for UTEC&#8230;.each year building upon the success of all his work this past&nbsp;year.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Our Americorps VISTA project focused on increasing the capacity and sustainability of UTEC&#8217;s Multimedia programs through various development-based responsibilities. Diliana was responsible for grantwriting (specifically focused on enhancing our community technology programs), organizing special events (fundraisers, open houses, etc.), coordinating phone-a-thons, developing PR materials and UTEC’s first-ever annual report.  Diliana was expected to work with and train teen leaders in all aspects of their development&nbsp;work. </p>
<p>Specific responsibilities&nbsp;included: </p>
<p>•Attend, participate, and occasionally facilitate all staff meetings and planning&nbsp;retreats.</p>
<p>•Serve as a counselor and role model for youth involved in the Fundraising&nbsp;Team. </p>
<p>•Design and carry out annual development&nbsp;workplan.</p>
<p>•Research and write grant&nbsp;proposals. </p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Diliana’s background in communications has only strengthened her contribution to UTEC by focusing on increasing the capacity and sustainability of our multimedia programs through various development-based responsibilities.  She also works with and trains teen leaders of the Fundraising Team in all aspects of their development work.  In addition, she assists with the program development in the areas of video production, sound recording, and web design.  It is obvious what a tremendous asset Diliana is for our organization, but it is also apparent that Diliana herself has grown professionally from the hands-on development work of our multimedia programs.  She plans to continue this type of work well into the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Diliana has played a major role in being an active participant in the organization’s overall development.  She has consistently supported her co-workers, emphasizing the team environment at UTEC.  Diliana has the skills to bring an idea to life.  For instance, UTEC’s first major fundraiser will be taking place early next month.  Diliana worked with teens in the Fundraising Team to gather ideas/themes for the event.  Since then, she has developed and followed a timeline to make the event a future&nbsp;success!</p>
<p>Diliana has accomplished the following major tasks as based upon her workplan:<br />
•	Completion of first-ever UTEC newsletter (second issue now in progress)<br />
•	Just recently completed first-ever Annual Report.<br />
•	Completed three monthly Open House Nights (and built a system for carrying out this work).<br />
•	Developed new mailing list for all fundraising activities.<br />
•	Secured donations from various businesses as part of program ads for newsletter.<br />
•	Completed and submitted various grant applications (as well as grantwriting training course).<br />
•	Developed new bios for all staff.<br />
•	Currently documenting all work as part of a new Fundraising Resource Guide.<br />
•	Currently planning a special event fundraiser to support a new capital campaign.<br />
•	Interviewed and hired teen fundraising&nbsp;staff.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Approximately two weeks ago, the United Nations celebrated its annual International Day of Peace.  As UTEC was invited to participate in this event (celebrated in Boston), we decided to put together a videotape of how young people define peace in their own local communities.  Dirk was able to work with many young people to get this video accomplished and shown in front of all those in attendance at this event. There is some amazing footage on this tape, particularly of older gang members (ages 22-25) who speak about their own experiences of violence and how they are now working with UTEC’s Peace Team on mediation work with current gang members in Lowell.  Dirk did an excellent job of putting this work together so that it would best reflect the voices of these young&nbsp;people.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Chanvon has been involved in three major projects: Technology Goes Home, Youth Mapping, and street outreach recruitment particularly targeting young&nbsp;women.</p>
<p>Regardingthe Technology Goes Home Program, Chanvon has been able to coordinate with our PC repair program to ensure that the 4 families enrolled all received refurbished computers.  All 4 families completed the program. All families attended all sessions of the program, completing the curriculum designed by Tech Goes Home&nbsp;Boston.</p>
<p>With regard to the youth mapping, our team of nine youth mappers have canvassed most of the downtown area. The youth attended a full-day training June 27th, where they learned about the importance of mapping, interviewing skills and the surveys <span class="amp">&amp;</span> database that are fundamental to the&nbsp;process.  </p>
<p>And lastly, in terms of Chanvon’s involvement in the street outreach recruitment, she spent 2-3 times during the week doing outreach with the other recruiters to get young women involved in our programs, specifically technology-related&nbsp;programs.</p>

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
