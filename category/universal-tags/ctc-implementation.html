With regular lab hours he is able to make himself available on a consistent basis for the entire student body.  Mark also helps teachers with class projects that include working with students on particular software programs or internet research, etc. Responding to staff IT needs, Mark is able to work on a one-on-one basis providing training and helping staff identify ways in which technology can make their work more&nbsp;efficient.</p>
<p>Mark has also been working with the Family Literacy program, an off-site program where we provide literacy classes to parents in partnering elementary&nbsp;schools. </p>
<p>Mark has also been instrumental in integrating the community wide technology workshops offered during our Community Days.  Community Days take place on periodic Saturdays and are open to the community at large, especially the immediate neighborhood.  They offer a variety of educational workshops and social services.  During Community Day, Mark was able to hold an open computer lab with activities designed for children, as many of the Community Day activities were family&nbsp;oriented.</p>

                    <p>When James first joined Boat People S.O.S. (BPSOS) as an AmeriCorps*VISTA Member he was assigned multiple tasks as set forth in his AmeriCorps*VISTA Member Assignment Description.  He was able to successfully complete the objectives of Goal 1 for Quarter 1.  However, he was not able to complete Objective 2a, to implement an ESL class at the House for Senior Citizens at the Lockwood/Elmwood in Arlington, Virginia for two reasons.  First, the occupants did not feel the ESL class was necessary (they were only interested in learning about the Internet and computers).  Second, James was not able to recruit a volunteer to teach the class.  He did successfully complete Objectives 2b and&nbsp;2c.</p>
<p>For Quarter 3, James assisted a BPSOS staff in setting up new program for Victims of Trafficking.  He worked on this program for approximately one month and then he assisted another staff member with the Tax Assistance for Vietnamese Immigrants with Low Income (TAVILLI) program.  From January 1 through April 23, he organized tax preparation sessions 3 days a week, 2 hours each session.  He recruited volunteers and established a database containing names of volunteers that may help with future tax clinics.  He went out in the Vietnamese community and distributed 800 flyers advertising free tax preparation.  He enrolled 300 individuals for tax preparation, and kept a database of those individuals. When he enrolled the individuals for tax preparation, he gave out a needs assessment/opinion survey for them to complete. This survey informed individuals about programs available at BPSOS (computer, ESL and&nbsp;etc…).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was unable to complete the objectives as stated in Quarter 4 before the end of his one-year service because the first issue of BPSOS Mach Song was not published until July 2002.  However, he did update BPSOS newsletter database.   This database contains names of past and current BPSOS clients as well as others who want to receive the newsletter in the mail.   Articles written in the newsletter highlight human-interest stories as well as provide information of services available to&nbsp;individuals.</p>

                    <p>David has assisted TSN Coordinator with the procurement, development, distribution and evaluation of instructional materials for member&nbsp;sites.  </p>
<p>David has met with eligible sites independently and jointly with TSN coordinator as well as helped procure and disseminate information between sites and the TSN coordinator.  Because of David’s technical background and ability to grasp the complete picture he has resolved many problems and questions before they could become issues.  Once the financial issues are resolved, David will independently visit the Centers receiving equipment to ensure that its installation is complete and satisfies the Center’s requirements.  As a result of the David’s assistance the current round of hardware and furniture upgrades is ahead of last years&nbsp;pace. </p>
<p>David is serving as the Project Manager for the re-design of the website). Davis is coordinating the translation of a portion of the website into Spanish and is keeping the content of the web site up to date.  David frequently provides help desk support to members using the&nbsp;site. </p>
<p>David is currently serving as a fifth-grade group leader for the Kinetic City program. Kinetic City is a science-based program aligned with Boston Public School standards for grades 3-6 designed to be offered in out-of school time. David along with key staff from member sites will be trained to both run the program and sites as well as on how to train others to lead the program.  David will provide important feedback as we pilot this train-the-trainer program being developed jointly with MIT’s Kavli&nbsp;Institute.  </p>
<p>• David has developed and is maintaining two databases for managing the information needed for reporting to our funders—Boston Connects, Inc. and the Timothy Smith Fund. These databases track information for 40 sites, hundreds of classes, and thousands of&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>• David completed a series of classes at BNN TV’s Multimedia Center and used these new skills to video the recent Girls Get Connected Conference.  It is anticipated that he will turn this into a CD or DVD which can be used for publicity for upcoming conferences.  David will also use these skills to create a CD or DVD of success stories of individuCenter&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>I must take this opportunity to comment on David directly.  He demonstrates a level of maturity far beyond that which I have seen from others in his position.  His attention to detail and in depth-technical skills have has enabled him to successfully create and<br />
maintain the databases critical to the TSN’s daily operation.  David’s work ethic is outstanding—he is never late, he is never absent, he never complains, he is totally reliable.  If I give his something to get done he does it on time and accurately with a minimum of input, much less supervision.  David demonstrates real depth and breadth of perspective in meetings with funders, meeting with TS Center staff, and in meetings with the TSN Steering Committee.  Of particular note is the “business acumen” he applies to the TSN which he acquired through planning his business in&nbsp;Milwaukee.</p>

                    <p>Sue has helped us launch our project nationally, and we know have over 350 affordable and public housing facilities using “Abilities for Resident Service Coordinators” to link low income frail elderly and disabled residents to community services.  “Abilities for Resident Service Coordinators” has been endorsed by the American Association of Service Coordinators and is acknowledged by industry professionals as a vital tool in keeping elderly residents in independent living.  With the infusion of technology in elderly and disabled resident service coordination, properties are able to keep residents independent, and avoid unnecessary and costly institutionalization.  This project is a prime example of using community technology to meet pressing needs, and impact important policy&nbsp;areas. </p>
<p>Sue helped us attend a national conference in San Antonio, Texas, in which we brought 20 laptops and set up a training lab.  We taught Resident Service Coordinators how to use technology to link their residents to community services, manage their residmonitor resident and program outcomes with&nbsp;technology. </p>
<p>Sue has been a vital player in helping us develop an implementation plan for CTCs in affordable housing communities in Southern California, as she is at our office early every day to assist with implementation.  Her involvement helped us determine that we could expand beyond 50 to now over 200&nbsp;CTCs. </p>
<p>Sue led the effort at Pangea Foundation to develop the training manual for our users.  She has helped develop the 100+ page training manual that is available to users when they log into the system.  This is an ongoing effort.  She also helps with phone training, and attended our training conference in San Antonio,&nbsp;Texas.</p>
<p>Sue has helped run the show at Pangea with the Resident Service Coordinators.  She is the first to receive their calls when they need technical help.  She continuously tests the systems.  She helped create the training manuals and system forms for printed materials.  Sue’s involvement as an AmeriCorp*VISTA member enables our organization to provide these services to the community. To date, this system has over 200 properties using it, which represents service delivered and managed to 20,000 low income elderly and disabled residents across the&nbsp;country.</p>

1) Better community service through better information and outreach:  VISTA workers will assist us with Community Mapping and community Outreach to determine modifications to services at existing CTC’s and the location of additional CTC’s<br />
2) Definition and documentation of the methods, the curriculum, and the effectiveness of the Byte Back model, the Technology Expert Organization (TEO), so that others may benefit from this success.<br />
3) Establishing a sustainability program so that Byte Back is not reliant on grants for continued existence and&nbsp;service.”</p>

                    <p>While actual canvassing of the local neighborhood was fruitful for relationships in our home neighborhood, networking with other organizations was more effective when we were exploring territory that was new to us.  We have provided assistance to many new organizations and this assistance ranges from extensive and on-going to brief and by&nbsp;request.  </p>
<p>VISTAs helped shape Byte Back’s future through the information gathered in community mapping and other outreach activities. Although we initially thought computer sales and fees for specific tasks might provide sustainability for Byte Back, our understanding the needs of the non-profit community changed through community mapping and attending or leading events and focus groups.  We found that many local non-profits had little idea how to meet their technical needs economically, and also needed assistance integrating program and technical planning. Often they relied on irregular volunteers or expensive consultants. Because of these needs revealed through our outreach programs, we have developed a Tech Gap Working Group which is redirecting our efforts towards the providing of planning and&nbsp;services.</p>

                    <p>BPSOS’s project ACCESS, Access to Computers for Community Empowerment, Support and Services, hopes to improve English fluency and the acquisition of computer skills in the low-income community. During year one the VISTA member will work on the following&nbsp;tasks:</p>
<p>1. Work with community groups to identify youth needing the service and mobilize their participation in the program.<br />
2. Set up neighborhood-based classes. This involves identification of additional resources to support these classes (such as donated computers, text books, class space, supplies).<br />
3. Teach ESL and computer classes. This will include tailoring existing class materials to the needs of the target population.<br />
4. Recruit, train, and coordinate volunteers to serve as instructors and mentors.<br />
5. Encourage parents to take part in the education of their&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>During year 2 the VISTA goals were the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p>Goal 1:  Establish new CTC<br />
Goal 2:  After-school activities for youth<br />
Goal 3:  Community outreach<br />
Goal 4:  Community&nbsp;events</p>

                    <p>Between the months of September and December, I worked with my fellow VISTA, Co Kim Oanh, and my supervisor, Bach Pham, to reaffirm community contacts by recruiting volunteers, outreaching to prospective clients, and acquiring space for a CTC.  While Bach worked with BPSOS’s IT guy to acquire computers, I focused on recruiting volunteers to teach a series of Computer Literacy/ESL classes to current BPSOS clients. Through websites and phone calls, we recruited a small group of 4-5 volunteers that agreed to teach ESL/Computer Literacy combo&nbsp;classes.</p>

                    <p>Beth and Edith worked well above their call of duty to lead the efforts of designing a system that helped bring technology solutions to low-income senior and disabilities housing properties. They worked directly with staff at affordable housing properties for seniors and people with disabilities as well as the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Southern California office to make sure that Pangea designed a system that could help low-income seniors and people with disabilities use technology to access community resources to meet their need. They designed the functional specification of the system, and then worked daily with Pangea’s software developers to oversee the development of the system. They have been praised by every organization they worked with, especially HUD’s Southern California Neighborhood Networks team&nbsp;leader.</p>
