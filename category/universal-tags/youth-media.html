                    <p>Our Community Media Center is a cooperative of public access, nonprofit media including, GRTV, WYCE, GrandNet, the Grand Rapids Institute for Information Democracy (GRIID), the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Educaiton (MOLLIE) and the Wealthy Theater.  We provide individuals and groups with access to the tools training and means of transmission they need to join our mission of &#8220;Building community through&nbsp;media&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our VISTA member will assist in video and other media productions, primarily with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE).  MoLLIE works in large part with youth in the local financially struggling school system to help teachers fulfill curriculum requirements while also teaching the students the skills of video production using digital video cameras and iBook computers for&nbsp;editing.</p>

                    <p>Over the course of Sarah&#8217;s Vistaship she has been instrumental in working with our various youth training programs providing a wide variety of skills. She was responsible for helping students make the best videos possible and teaching them to think critically about media and media messages. She took the initiative to outreach to communities we hadn&#8217;t worked with in the past including GLBT and the Triangle Foundation, and solidified relationships with them and our organization. She helped plan a film festival and worked on several video installations dealing with issues such as the war and discrimination. In addition, Sarah has helped out in our theater by operating the lighting board for concerts, selling tickets and running concessions. She teaches video production and editing classes to our members and so much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Here is a list of projects Sarah was involved in during her VISTA&nbsp;year:</p>
<p>1.Allegan County Community Mental Health: produced, shot and edited a documentary about the stigma of mental&nbsp;illness.</p>
<p>2. G.E.T. Girls Empowering Together: since January worked with a group of High School girls in a leadership mentoring program to mentor, produce, shot and edit a documentary about the program, “Breaking the Surface,” available for viewing at <a href="http://www.archive.org" title="www.archive.org">www.archive.org</a></p>
<p>3. The MOLLIE Club: a weekly video club for students in middle School that provides an opportunity for them to come in and Make&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>4. MOLLIE (Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education): Went to area schools and non-profits teaching youth how to produce, shoot and edit&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>5. Real Pride: helped start the planning process for a film and documentary series about LGBT&nbsp;issues.</p>

                    <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah had an especially strong bond with [the G.E.T. program participants] and it was great to see their reaction to the documentary we helped them produce. They had a really fancy dinner with a lot of area dignitaries in attendance when the documentary was screened for the first time. Many commented to us afterwards about what a great project this was and committed to funding another program this year.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>Our core media arts education program, The Lab, is a free after-school workshop that challenges Brooklyn high school students to produce short documentary videos about their lives.  This program incorporates lessons in literacy (story-telling, scripting, editing), self-esteem and tolerance, technology and media literacy within the context of 1:1 mentoring with professional&nbsp;filmmakers.</p>
<p>The Lab Assistant will work with the Lab Coordinator, Directors, and other staff to enhance the capacity of The Lab, Reel Impact, and all other programs of Reel Works Teen Filmmaking. Duties include, but are not limited&nbsp;to</p>
<p>- media arts&nbsp;instruction;</p>
<p>- maintenance of technical equipment and media&nbsp;collection;</p>
<p>- assisting with the recruitment and training of volunteer filmmaker&nbsp;mentors;</p>
<p>- developing and maintaining relationships with schools, community centers, and neighborhoods in Brooklyn served by Reel&nbsp;Works;</p>
<p>- developing a youth advisory&nbsp;board;</p>
<p>- assisting with the distribution/outreach and public&nbsp;relations;</p>
<p>- and performing various administrative duties as&nbsp;needed.</p>

                    <p>In a lab used mainly by young people on a daily basis we run into many technical/equipment malfunctions that oftentimes have no explanation. Reel Works Teen Filmmaking operates on a &#8220;shoe-string&#8221; budget and would not have been as successful in the past year had it not been for Micheil&#8217;s superior troubleshooting skills. Oftentimes, the members of our skeleton staff would attempt to trouble shoot errors while simultaneously running other programs and teaching a class - making for a very hectic and crazy work day. The days we were fortunate enough to work with Micheil were always the most productive. The young people in our program owe a lot of their stress-free success to&nbsp;Micheil.</p>

                    <p>In developing OLLIE’s digital distribution strategy, Gariet has achieved three major&nbsp;accomplishments.</p>
<p>First, Gariet brought the OLLIE program and Portland Community Media into the Youth Video Exchange Network (YVXN) as a steering partner. OLLIE’s participation in YVXN has allowed us to share broadcast quality student work with other youth media centers around the country, as well as acquire youth media content to broadcast on our own&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p>In parallel to his work with NYMAP, Gariet also researched and set up a blip.tv site for the OLLIE program. This site allows us to share our videos with others at any time, and in turn allows our visitors to post the videos on their websites and&nbsp;blogs.</p>
<p>Finally, Gariet developed a website for the project using the Drupal content management system. This site provides a comprehensive resource about the program for the communities we serve, and includes a searchable video database. Through his research and work with Drupal and blip.tv for our youth project, Gariet has set a course for the Media Center as a whole. Recently a staff member expressed that Gariet’s ability to explain the benefits and values of these technologies to others led to the media center to develop a digital distribution plan that incorporated the lessons he has learned. Gariet’s work has also had an impact on the larger community, including interesting and attracting a local foundation to provide operational funding for our&nbsp;project.</p>

Gariet is also an excellent teacher.  He is able to engage and inspire his students as they plan and create their video projects. Gariet&#8217;s positive attitude about working with this project and VISTA is enjoyed by those who work with him.  His commitment to helping others and the value of youth media is appreciated.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>The Community Art Center is committed to our mission of nurturing children and young adults with limited access to financial resources so they achieve personal and cultural growth, and have a positive impact on their world through joyful experiences in the&nbsp;arts.</p>
<p>Through our 75 years in operation we have propelled close to 8000 Cambridge youth to develop themselves artistically, academically, and socially. We achieve this by providing a combined total of approximately 3000 program hours per year through two central programs: School Age Child Care (SACC) and the Teen Media Program&nbsp;(TMP).</p>
<p>The Art Center serves the public housing developments and the surrounding ‘Area 4’ neighborhood in Cambridge. Approximately 80% of housing development families live below the poverty level, with many receiving public assistance. Our 2 programs capture the creative spirit of children who without us would be “at home bored, doing nothing” or “on the&nbsp;streets.” </p>
<p>A School Age Child Care (SACC) Program, engages children, ages 5-12, in a hands-on arts-based curriculum year-round, operating after-school Mon-Fri 2:00-6:00 pm and all day weekdays during school vacations and&nbsp;summer.</p>
<p>The Teen Media Program (TMP), for youth 13-19, gives teens an opportunity to be heard by the larger public through the media arts. TMP offers seasonal Youth Media training and leadership facilitation. Partners include Boys and Girls Groups, Genuine Productions (a youth business venture) and Youth Advisory&nbsp;Board.</p>
