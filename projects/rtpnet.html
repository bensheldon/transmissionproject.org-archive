                <span class="field-content"><p>Goal 1: Continue the after-school computer-training program (CLICK) for students at Rogers-Herr Middle School in Durham, North&nbsp;Carolina.</p>
<p>Goal 2: Expand the computer-training program (CLICK) to a community technology center (CTC), such as the West End Community Center or the Lakewood Center in Durham, North&nbsp;Carolina.</p>
<p>Goal 3: Further develop and evaluate the template for scaling and replicating the program in North Carolina and nationwide.The main purpose of the CLICK website is to allow other organizations access to the&nbsp;lessons.</p>
<p>Goal 4: Encourage public and private sector resources to enable the project to continue after the Members&nbsp;leave.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>A pretest and post-test was implemented during the first section of CLICK, which underscored the need for CLICK and the quality of the lessons.  The pretest/post-test was a shortened version of the skills portion of the North Carolina Computer Competency Exam.  The mean score on the pretest of the students who completed CLICK was 22.5%, with a high score of 49% and a low score of 6%.  Coming into CLICK the students were lacking the most basic of computer skills.  The mean score on the post-test of those same students was 74.3%, with a high score of 89% and a low score of 60%; a drastic improvement.  On an individual student basis, no student increased his or her score by less than 32 percentage points.  With a mean score increase of 51 percentage points, it is clear that CLICK is both needed and&nbsp;effective.</p>
<p>Some of Chad&#8217;s major accomplishments have been that he successfully introduced the program to Lyon&#8217;s Park Community Center; revised all of the lesson plans and oversaw the development of new lessons for the younger audience at Lyon&#8217;s Park; completely redid the website; instigated the donation of computers from the Franklin Center to Rogers-Herr; put together background and procedural information for future coordinators of CLICK; instigated a relationship with Gary Ybarra in Engineering, which resulted in $5,000 worth of support in the form of assistant coordinators; and successfully set up the program for next year (so the transition is as seamless as&nbsp;possible).</p>
<p>The relationship between CLICK and the Rogers-Herr after-school program has changed in the past and most likely will change in the future.  During the first semester of CLICK there were two sections meeting twice a week.  One section was for students enrolled in the after school program and one section was for students who were not part of the after school program.  Attendance for the after school section was very poor while attendance for the non-after-school section was good.  This was caused, at least in part, by changes in after-school administration and staff shortages at&nbsp;Rogers-Herr.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>“In tutoring the youth in our CommUNITY Scholars program, I&#8217;ve noticed many have computer homework assignments as early as the 4th grade! Students are asked to write essays and to research cities, nature or historical figures. Most are familiar with the computer from playing computer games or surfing the web but do not know how to use software tools or how to properly position their hands to type. CLICK teaches basic skills to allow students to efficiently complete homework assignments and, ultimately, have more confidence functioning in a growing computer-based world.”<br />

New software was acquired from fees from computer classes and donations. She has forged a partnership with Goodwill Training for free online&nbsp;classes.</p>
<p>Working with GCF online training, she has renewed her partnership with them and now facilitates classes of Adult students&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>She is upgrading the computer lab. She has gotten more furniture for the lab. She will be acquiring from Teaming for Technology 20 upgraded units (17 for the lab and 3 to go to students in the community). The Lab will also be re&nbsp;networked.</p>
<p>She is also a Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA) Pride Ambassador. She assists the bus drivers with issues that she can handle to help the bus driver do his job more effectively. She goes to monthly meetings to help in transportation decisions for her community. The perk that comes with this is that she gets to ride the bus free for a&nbsp;year.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Douglas worked with Duke University faculty and students to develop CLICK (Creating Literacy in Computer Knowledge), a computer literacy training program for 6th graders. CLICK develops computer skills for at-risk middle school students, engaging them in an after-school setting that is interactive and fun. CLICK lessons include Internet research, word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and multimedia presentations.

                <span class="field-content"><p>This year has been successful, for we conducted the following classes here at the Riley Hill Technology Center:  Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, as well as Introduction to the personal computer. The total number of students attending was 54. As Ella says, “I was blessed with seven volunteer instructors by advertising in the community. I was also privileged to teach Microsoft Word with an Introduction to the Personal&nbsp;Computer.”</p>
<p>A Computer Repair course was developed for Riley Hill Community Technology Center. Ella decided to use two resources to develop this course: Computer Concepts (Third Edition) and Technology for Social Change&#8217;s curriculum (<a href="http://www.tecschange.org" title="www.tecschange.org">www.tecschange.org</a>) with their permission. Ella also planned to use the RTPnet site as a reference for this&nbsp;course.</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Developing this course has helped Ella to better troubleshoot computers, for there are individuals in the community that are in dire need of help.  These individuals bring their personal computers to the center for technical support. In the Wendell Community and surrounding areas, the Riley Hill Technology Center is the only source that does not charge a fee for&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>We very grateful to add our source of Volunteers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Technology Resources. We have used the following sources this year&nbsp;(2003-2004):</p>
<p>•	Schools (K-12) students as well as other personnel<br />
•	Community Colleges<br />
•	Libraries (Public and Other)<br />
•	Local businesses<br />
•	Wake Forest Pediatrics (Wake Forest, NC)<br />
•	Churches (Wakefield, Zebulon First Baptist etc.)<br />
•	RTP.net (Website)<br />
•	Family and Friends of staff members<br />
•	Department of Social Services (Eastern Regional Center, Zebulon)<br />
•	Retired Senior&nbsp;citizens</p>
<p>The quality of life has improved for the youth and adults who have taken computer classes at the center, however updating the computer equipment as well as software is still needed. We are currently looking for funding for this project and for a long-term way of sustaining the center.  The Riley Hill Survey Plan has given some insight on how to get this plan&nbsp;implemented.</p>

She is very dependable, very cooperative, a team player, and continues to be an asset to the Riley Hill Community. Her interaction with others (peers, youth, students, etc.) is outstanding. During this time period, there have not been any negative comments received regarding Ella. To sum it up, I would rate her as &#8216;Consistently Exceeds&#8217; the requirements in all aspects of the job.&#8221;<br />

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
