                    <p>119 Gallery seeks an individual to lead the expansion and development of the organization&#8217;s marketing, outreach and community building activities so we can reach and serve a larger population. Utilizing multiple communication venues, we will develop a solid strategic communications plan to inform our community members of offerings and engage them in programming. The Gallery&#8217;s robust programs of events, education, and exhibits draw a steady crowd of artists, community members, and young people.  It has a number of systems (both operational and technical) in place to handle the strategic communications of the organization, but they are fragmented and lack focus.  The CTC VISTA member would design and create a cohesive system that will more effectively leverage the organizations skills and capacities to engage and educate our community&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>·	Assess organization&#8217;s current outreach, marketing and communication activities with strategic communications in&nbsp;mind</p>
<p>·	Assess organization&#8217;s current communication infrastructure (web, email, social networks, print, mail,&nbsp;press)</p>
<p>·	Gather member input into strategic communication&nbsp;needs</p>
<p>·       Establish networking and outreach and shared communications with collaborating&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>·	Research and recommend new processes for integrating and redesiging in a more efficient and strategic manner the organization&#8217;s outreach, marketing and communications activities with an eye toward greater community impact and&nbsp;involvement</p>
<p>·	Design and implement this new strategic communications&nbsp;plan</p>
<p>·	Create a set of evaluation metrics and benchmarks that will enable the organization to track is&nbsp;progress</p>
<p>·	Train interns, volunteers and staff in the effective use of and maintainence of the new communications&nbsp;system</p>
<p>·	Provide additional strategic input and staffing support for all gallery programmatic areas, including Identifying and meeting with community organizations that share our mission   and&nbsp;constituency.</p>

                    <p>Mira has succeeded in organizing our overall marketing. She is working with a volunteer from the the Jericho Road Foundation to establish a comprhensive marketing plan. She is a member of the 199 Gallery Board&#8217;s Marketing Subcommittee. She maintains Facebook and Myspace pages, posting notices and invites as appropriate. She edits and emails a bimonthly newsletter using Constant Contact. She has participated in the design and development of several fund raising events including the Jazz Brunch, and Dinner <span class="amp">&amp;</span> A Movie. She organized the annual membership renewal campaign, Show Us The Love. She has updated the gallery database. She assists in recruiting and managing&nbsp;volunteers.</p>
<p>The database was a mess, Mira fixed it! She created the newsletter from scratch and in addition has established a good working relationship with the local newspaper, the Lowell&nbsp;SUN.</p>
<p>Mira helped us with press release, created a social networking site which has over 500 fans, worked on our monthly newsletter and multiple&nbsp;fundraisers.</p>
<p>In addition, Mira joined several community projects, sent out a marketing survey to Gallery members, and, over Labor Day weekend, participated in the Bumpkin Island Artists Encampment over Labor Day Weekend. She also coordinated the Jazz Brunch, our annual&nbsp;fundraiser.</p>
<p>We did not get the completed manual for future training, but as a result of Mira&#8217;s work, we have much more visibility and are growing in terms of members and&nbsp;programming.</p>

                    <p>Richard was a crucial part of the Mollie youth video team, providing youth access and exposure to digital video technology during Mollie moviemaking video projects with schools and community groups.

                    <p>Richard assisted the education department with youth outreach curriculum development efforts, developing innovative ways to expose community youth to digital audio and video technology. He developed interest surveys for school and community info. gathering and assisted with the implementation of an open house for CMC Wealthy neighborhood residents. Richard was a member of the SMART Festival planning team, an international student media arts festival organized and hosted by&nbsp;GRCMC..</p>
<p>A particular story that stands out is the use of audio resources and curriculum developed by Richard: There was a young man named Patrick who was 14 years of age and lived across the street from Media Center with his Mom and 6 brothers and sisters. He would drop by the media center often after school. He learned a variety of video production skills and produced a few short studio productions for air on community television, but nothing seemed to really stick with him.  One day we asked him to produce and record a rap that could be used for promotion of the Mollie youth program. You could see the excitement in his eyes at that suggestion. In a matter of weeks he had the rap written out and beats to use with it created on the computer.  Using the tools and resources Richard had collected and organized, we were able to both find a passion for this young man and help promote our programs and&nbsp;organization.</p>

                    <p>The College of Public and Community Service is one of five colleges that comprise the University of Massachusetts Boston campus. As such, CPCS seeks to extend the tradition of the land grant university in a number of&nbsp;ways:</p>
<p>Educating students to foster the public good and aid the transformation to a more equitable society<br />
Providing research, advocacy, technical assistance, and service to the surrounding community<br />
Forging partnerships with public agencies and community organizations that enhance the quality of life for low income and other inadequately served populations<br />
In these ways, the college works toward overcoming the attitudes, beliefs, and structures in our society which prevent access to the resources that exist and discourage full participation in economic, civic, cultural and political life. As an alternative educational institution, CPCS endeavors to function as an inclusive, democratic, and participatory learning community which promotes diversity, equality, and social&nbsp;justice.</p>
<p>CPCS actively cultivates a diverse and mature student body and offers an empowering and effective education which equips students to advocate for themselves and to improve the health and well-being of their chosen communities. The college recognizes that, particularly in a multicultural society, such an educational enterprise is inextricably bound to the complementary goals of meaningful access and adequate support for underserved populations. The successful CPCS graduate is a competent, confident, self-directed, life long learner who can&nbsp;demonstrate:</p>
<p>Language and technical skills necessary for purposeful inquiry and communication<br />
Professional competence to function effectively in a broad range of workplace and community-based roles and activities<br />
Critical consciousness needed to clarify and challenge prevailing values, ideologies, and practices<br />
Essential knowledge required for participating fully in&nbsp;society</p>
<p>The CPCS curriculum is designed with such students in mind. The core of this inventive educational system is an outcome-oriented curriculum in which prior learning is validated and collaborative projects are encouraged. At CPCS, the student is considered a resource in the educational process, and the acquisition of knowledge and skills intersects with experiential learning and field-based education. As a forward-looking educational institution, CPCS continues to explore innovative delivery systems and technologies and seeks to articulate its educational philosophy and pedagogy with other academic institutions, community organizations, and public&nbsp;agencies.</p>
