                    <p>One of the main goals of the PREP Computer Training program is to provide the technology training needed for inner-city residents to get well-paying jobs. To do this, one of our long-term goals is to provide training needed for professional computer&nbsp;certifications.</p>
<p>We would use the Americorps*VISTA member to help run the walk-in computer lab as well as to help assist with some of our classes. In the walk-in lab, the VISTA members would help answer people&#8217;s questions and assist them in their work. They would also work with the youth staff that we have working in the&nbsp;lab.</p>
<p>The VISTA member would also assist in teaching our classes on Saturdays. VISTA members could assist with whatever class that suits their technical&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
<p>The third area VISTA members couls assist in is in providing computer training to youth in our after school program during the afternoon a couple of times a&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Depending on the VISTA member&#8217;s technical capabilities, they may also assist in the technical support of the lab as well as helping work with the youth in our youth-run Web design business. For each of these areas, we would provide the VISTA member with training and mentors to help guide&nbsp;them.</p>

                    <p>One of the main goals of the PREP Computer Training program is to provide the technology training needed for inner-city residents to get well-paying jobs. To do this, one of our long-term goals is to provide training needed for professional computer&nbsp;certifications.</p>
<p>We would use the Americorps*VISTA member to help run the walk-in computer lab as well as to help assist with some of our classes. In the walk-in lab, the VISTA members would help answer people&#8217;s questions and assist them in their work. They would also work with the youth staff that we have working in the&nbsp;lab.</p>
<p>The VISTA member would also assist in teaching our classes on Saturdays. VISTA members could assist with whatever class that suits their technical&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
<p>The third area VISTA members couls assist in is in providing computer training to youth in our after school program during the afternoon a couple of times a&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Depending on the VISTA member&#8217;s technical capabilities, they may also assist in the technical support of the lab as well as helping work with the youth in our youth-run Web design business. For each of these areas, we would provide the VISTA member with training and mentors to help guide&nbsp;them.</p>

                    <p>VISTA Objectives to be Addressed:<br />
Objective 1: To engage neighborhood young people in positive youth development and community service&nbsp;activities. </p>
<p>The project’s primary emphasis is on educational enrichment of youth in the 3rd – 8th grades that will lead to success in middle and high school years. This will be done in a four day per week after school program. Individualized basic skill tasks will be practiced daily, followed by enriching group learning activities chosen by students. A three day a week open lab will be available to other youth and adults who wish to use computers.  Those who show leadership interests and technology abilities will be trained as computer lab assistants to help other youth access machines and software as well as help take care of the&nbsp;lab.</p>
<p>Objective 2: To provide children and youth with prevention and intervention&nbsp;services. </p>
<p>As a part of a larger neighborhood consortium the members will receive children and youth who enter the Center feeling unsafe and help them reach their family or other authorities for&nbsp;assistance.</p>
<p>Objective 3: To recruit and utilize community volunteers to expand and enhance services at AmeriCorps host sites and other organizations addressing community needs in the above&nbsp;areas.</p>
<p>AmeriCorps members will recruit tutors, group coaches and other volunteers for scheduled programs, open labs and lab technical help from many sources.  They will use the media, including neighborhood outlets, church-related newsletters and bulletins, to inform the public of opportunities to serve.  They will also make presentations at churches and other venues to recruit, and will provide follow-up and coordination of volunteers who are either committed or exploring the possibility of joining the Center lab staff.  They will also use various occasions to recognize the work of the volunteers, including letters of thanks, recognition parties, and small tokens of&nbsp;appreciation.</p>

She participates in their dance programs (Partner with Dazzle Theatre) and sports and health programs. She was instrumental in having 15 students participate in a filmmakers project, a collaboration between youth organizations, agencies, churches, WXXI, University of Rochester, and Road To Success. Youth were given an RCA video camera to shoot a 3 minute film. She instituted a case-management component to keep the participants/youth focused on their assignments/goals. She was able to recruit a significant number of volunteers over the period under review to repair computers, do etiquette training, and work on filmakers&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>The CTCNet VISTA, Ben Pratt, has provided invaluable service to the Durham Literacy Center (DLC) this year.  Ben has been able to collaborate with community partners and volunteers to specifically focus on technology and capacity building at DLC and other community technology centers in Durham. To date, he has completely overhauled DLC’s technical infrastructure, including our local area network, administrative computers, plus all computers at our CTC lab housed at our office.  DLC also runs two other community labs at partner sites.  Ben has made the labs more functional and accessible to our students and the general public.  Additionally, Ben has spearheaded the development of an ad hoc technology committee where he recruited local leaders in technology and IT professionals to participate.  This ad hoc committee has allowed DLC to establish standards for technology and implement best-practices for the use of technology with our adult learners.  We foresee this committee as being adopted by our board of directors as a permanent committee and will develop a long overdue technology plan for our agency.  We are also planning to get another VISTA next year to replace Ben.  This technology committee will ensure a quick transition as well as training and consistent development of DLC’s technology infrastructure and instructional technology&nbsp;use.</p>

                    <p>The property which provided space for our lab was sold to another owner.  The new owner wasn’t interested in keeping the programs.  We move all equipment which was held in storage for more than 7 months. We partnered with another local property and we moved twice to  new property.  Finally, in April we move to the final location for the computer&nbsp;lab.</p>
<p>These moves hindered Angela’s work with the lab.  However she was quite helpful in other areas.  She wrote the first MLK grant which was funded. She provided research for many of the grants that have been developed during the 8 months of her stay.  She developed the system for reporting and documenting for a new program brought on this year. She also developed the accounting and financial system documenting agency&nbsp;resources.</p>

She networked the computers to one laser printer and set up the eight new computers.  She developed a training curriculum for use with the summer and after-school&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>The positive results of the MLK grant provide an environmental program to teach youth about the value of our planet.  The youth also enjoyed a conference on “Discovering How Amazing you really are” and learning how to find the greatness within&nbsp;themselves.</p>

                    <p>• Completed a CTC lab inventory<br />
• Set-up user registration database and survey form<br />
• Established a set of rules and regulations for the users<br />
• Set up regular computer classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the months of July<br />
• Basic computer classes were taught with adults.<br />
• Oversaw the operations of the CTC<br />
• Working with volunteers to instruct basic classes<br />
• Set up policies and procedures for new computer&nbsp;center</p>
<p>Due to circumstances outside of Antonio’s control  (staff reduction at San Martin), Antonio had no supervision. It was decided that Antonio would try to work in the computer center at the new MAAC charter school. It turned out to be a good match. We feel that both Antonio and the Charter School have benefited from this new&nbsp;arrangement.</p>
