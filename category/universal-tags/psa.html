                    <p>The Americorps VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and piloting a technology class for our English speaking clients, the majority of whom are African-American. The goal is to motivate women from the HPP&#8217;s English speaking support groups to avail themselves of the resources in the computer lab.  To reinforce and extend the class experience, the Americorps*VISTA will create a weblog specifically for these clients where they can share their interests, issues, questions and accomplishments. The weblog community will serve as an additional support group to these parents as they seek ways out of poverty. Through participation in classes, one-on-one instruction, and the weblog, these clients will upgrade their job and communication&nbsp;skills.</p>
<p>Our 2004-2005 VISTA developed a community web-site for homeless families and families in jeopardy of becoming homeless.  This website is fast becoming a vital resource to such families and to case managers throughout the region for instant access to resource information.    This years Americorps VISTA would expand the use of the website by (1) developing a workshop to introduce the website to new users, both clients and case managers,  (2) develop promotional materials such as email announcements and posters, and (3) work with other volunteers to develop a separate homepage, navigation system and additional features just for case&nbsp;managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer would expand our program by developing and coordinating a staff development program in the CTC. Since one of the best practices for strengthening a program such as ours is to invest in our case workers, we are planning to use the CTC for more staff development than in previous years.  We will develop an on-line assessment tool to establish a baseline of the technology skills of all staff members. Using this data we will develop and coordinate skill set workshops tailored to staff needs that will be held in the&nbsp;CTC.  </p>
<p>To strengthen and  expand our job readiness program the Americorps*VISTA will be responsible for developing 5  In order to do this the VISTA will identify, contact and visit appropriate educational and vocational training programs.  In addition the VISTA will develop referral protocols between these programs and HPP Case&nbsp;Managers. </p>
<p>The Americorps*VISTA volunteer will also coordinate our &#8220;Computers in the Home&#8221; Project. This project takes our capacity to give technological skills and experience to the underserved population beyond the walls of our CTC. Funded to provide 40 families with refurbished computers and in-home tech support through ReliaTech, a social venture project of StreetTech of Richmond, CA., participants receive training and, upon completion of the training, computers and periodic in-home tech support. In addition, clients who have received computers for their homes continue to receive training at the HPP&#8217;s&nbsp;CTC. </p>
<p>Finally, the Americorps*VISTA will collaborate with our partners in the Community Connectivity Collaboration (One Economy, StreetTech, ReliaTech, Canal Alliance, TechFutures), a group formed to define needs of local CTC&#8217;s and find ways to seek funding. The VISTA will attend CCC meetings and other partnering events that may&nbsp;develop.</p>

                    <p>I know that I speak for the entire staff of the Homeless Prenatal Program (HPP) when I say that Ellen-Rae Cachola has been a boon to our organization. As her supervisor in the Community Technology Center it has been my pleasure to work very closely with her for the last 12 months. She is highly committed, intelligent, and industrious. She is extremely productive and always looking for new projects. She is also very personable, able to interact warmly with the diverse groups of people who work in our program and who come here for services. We are very lucky that she has stayed on at HPP as a part-time employee while she attends graduate school in San&nbsp;Francisco.  </p>
<p>Ellen&#8217;s duties at HPP have included maintaining two websites, teaching technology in English and in Spanish, maintaining and developing the client database on Microsft Access, as well as trouble shooting technology problems in the lab and at staff workstations. She has worked with the local cable television access station to create PSAs and informational programming. In addition she has created an online generator for our paper forms which allows staff to print forms on an as needed basis from their own computers. She has also designed and published agency literature and signage in english and in&nbsp;spanish.</p>

                    <p>Alli, working as a VISTA volunteer, has filled a huge void for BNN by assisting in promotions and outreach to the community. Through her first six months at BNN she has assisted not only the organization, but BNN producers in getting their message&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>In Alli&#8217;s second year at BNN she held the position of Youth Media Coordinator. Her duties included organizing a teen media club and producing a monthly program with the teens in the&nbsp;club.</p>

                    <p>She is currently helping to organize, write, and format BNN’s quarterly newsletter, our most important piece of literature sent to our members.  The newsletter introduces new equipment in our facilities, editing and production tips, and production class schedules. BNN has been unable to produce a newsletter since last winter, due to lack of staff and time, so Alli’s assistance in this is especially crucial.  Once the newsletter is completed it will be mailed to approximately 500 members and BNN typically receives a positive response from a large number of&nbsp;recipients. </p>
<p>Another example of Alli’s reach to the community is BNN’s Neighborhood Network News Program Highlights which Alli has been in charge of for the past six months.  The Program Highlights require Alli to be in close contact to all of our producers and to contact various shows on a weekly basis.  The Highlights also require her to send out a bulk mailing each month encouraging producers to contact her and let her know about their show, so that BNN can assist them in reaching as many people in the community as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Not only is Alli reaching out to community members, but during the next six months a lot of her attention will go to reaching out to community organizations. BNN provides non-profit organizations in the Greater Boston area a chance to produce a PSA highlighting their organization’s cause.  Alli will be responsible for the production and editing of these PSA’s, and she will assist BNN’s Education/Outreach department in contacting the organizations through phone calls, mailings and most importantly a “Get Your Message Out”&nbsp;seminar. </p>
<p>Over the last six months Alli has been a vital part in increasing BNN’s reach to the Boston community.  She has kept daily communication with many of our producers and the productions that she has assisted on have gotten her out into the community and aided BNN in delivering community&nbsp;messages.</p>
