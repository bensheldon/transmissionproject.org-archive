 <title>AMP Summit </title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/09/amp-summit</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We called it a revolution.  The people-powered movement fueled by the Internet and technology has forever changed the world of activism + media + politics. The goal of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AMP&lt;/span&gt; Summit is to explore the ongoing, distributed conversation about this&amp;nbsp;revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AMP&lt;/span&gt; Summit is an annual forum for influentials and thought leaders in the activist, media and political spheres. Public officials and regulators, experts from think tanks, trade associations, and public relations, and members of the media will attend. This conference in our nation’s capitol is intended to bring together respected colleagues and new friends to inspire new thinking, challenge traditional strategies, and create opportunities to learn from each&amp;nbsp;other. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gov 2.0 Summit</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/09/gov-20-summit</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gov 2.0 Summit brings together innovators from government and the private sector to highlight technology and ideas that can be applied to the nation’s great challenges. In areas as diverse as education, health care, energy, jobs, and financial reform, there are unique opportunities to rethink how government agencies perform their mission and serve our citizens. Social media, cloud computing, web, and mobile technologies—all provide new capabilities that government agencies are beginning to harness to achieve demonstrably better results at lower&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happening September 7-8 at the Grand Hyatt Washington, Gov 2.0 Summit brings the latest in technology thinking and capabilities to Washington, with fresh voices, cutting edge demos, and thought-provoking conversations. We explore the implications of the latest technology for policy, for the design of government programs, and for the implementation of government technology&amp;nbsp;strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear from industry giants like Cisco, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, Microsoft, and Google, as well as innovative startups like Palantir, drop.io, Slideshare, and more. You’ll also hear from leading government technology implementers and policymakers about their successes, the obstacles they face, and their plans for the future. Simply put, you’ll learn how the latest technology can transform the way you do your job and achieve your&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus this year is on opening the door to innovation — learning about the latest technology and its application, and breaking down the barriers to its&amp;nbsp;adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues you can expect to hear about at Gov 2.0 Summit&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * The Power of Platforms&lt;br /&gt;
    * Fueling the Innovation Economy&lt;br /&gt;
    * Identity, Privacy, and Informed Consent&lt;br /&gt;
    * Cost Savings and Doing More with Less&lt;br /&gt;
    * Empowering Citizens&lt;br /&gt;
    * Improving Government&amp;nbsp;Effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for you to request an invitation to attend this year’s event is now open. Last year’s event was sold out. Submit your request today and reserve your place in the&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/10/future-of-music-coalition-policy-summit-2010</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Future of Music Policy Summit&amp;nbsp;2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ten years of fighting for musicians, Future of Music Coalition has witnessed tremendous changes in the music ecosystem — from to disruptions in traditional business models to alternative revenue streams for creators. Throughout our history, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FMC&lt;/span&gt; has been guided by the conviction that musicians need access to audiences and adequate compensation to truly&amp;nbsp;thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10th Anniversary Future of Music Policy Summit puts the focus where it belongs: on the artists who are the very reason for our existence. It is the talent and creativity of musicians, songwriters and composers that bring clarity and focus to the pressing issues facing the entire music community.&lt;br /&gt;
Register in July for a discounted rate of $199.  Click here to register&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10th Anniversary Future of Music Policy Summit brings together an incredible array of musicians, arts advocates, policymakers, technologists, media representatives and industry figures to discuss issues at the intersection of music, technology, policy and law. Over three days, connections will be made, challenges will be identified, and solutions will be considered. Your participation in these conversations is crucial to the future of&amp;nbsp;music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us in celebrating 10 years of fighting for musicians as we look towards new&amp;nbsp;horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
