                    <p>Byte Back needs VISTA assistance to meet the following goals:<br />
1) Better community service through better information and outreach:  VISTA workers will assist us with Community Mapping and community Outreach to determine modifications to services at existing CTC’s and the location of additional CTC’s<br />
2) Definition and documentation of the methods, the curriculum, and the effectiveness of the Byte Back model, the Technology Expert Organization (TEO), so that others may benefit from this success.<br />
3) Establishing a sustainability program so that Byte Back is not reliant on grants for continued existence and&nbsp;service.”</p>

                    <p>While actual canvassing of the local neighborhood was fruitful for relationships in our home neighborhood, networking with other organizations was more effective when we were exploring territory that was new to us.  We have provided assistance to many new organizations and this assistance ranges from extensive and on-going to brief and by&nbsp;request.  </p>
<p>VISTAs helped shape Byte Back’s future through the information gathered in community mapping and other outreach activities. Although we initially thought computer sales and fees for specific tasks might provide sustainability for Byte Back, our understanding the needs of the non-profit community changed through community mapping and attending or leading events and focus groups.  We found that many local non-profits had little idea how to meet their technical needs economically, and also needed assistance integrating program and technical planning. Often they relied on irregular volunteers or expensive consultants. Because of these needs revealed through our outreach programs, we have developed a Tech Gap Working Group which is redirecting our efforts towards the providing of planning and&nbsp;services.</p>

                    <p>Progress has been made in the attendance of children and adults in the CTC&#8217;s maintained for Ed West. At the end of August, we had a 20% increase of children arriving after school to do their homework or just surf on the net since February. We have also made an increase of adult attendance in the courses we held. We have had at least 100 certificates to give to the graduates from our beginner&#8217;s computer courses. Our adults have learned the basics of Microsoft Office and Windows. They have even learned how to search for jobs and build perfect resumes. We have given away at least 50 computers in the last six months to MA Rehab clients and also students that have taken our courses. Donations were made regular by major companies and by individuals who wanted to give to our community. I have also updated all 30 computers with new software that was used by all participants. Especially learning tools for the&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>Part of Paul’s job was the development of a lesson plan to teach residents the basics of computers.  Paul was to create a lesson plan for 6 or 8 week classes that would engage residents with a completion date set, and a new class to begin subsequently.  This did not happen as planned and the one class that has met is still meeting after 12 weeks, with the same four students and no set plan to end.  Paul is not supposed to be teaching directly, but it was allowed assuming that new volunteers were being sought to step in to teach.  With very little success in recruiting and maintaining volunteers Paul chose to teach classes directly, in an effort to get the computer center&nbsp;utilized.</p>

                    <p>Melissa&#8217;s work in serving as Assistant Editor for the Community Technology Review online journal involved overseeing most communication with the authors; manuscript editing and development; online line production and design (a task she&#8217;s undertaken concurrent with learning to use online tools such as Dreamweaver); outreach; subscription management; and general systems and procedures development to insure a more smooth-running operation.  She has laid some useful preliminary foundations for advertising and&nbsp;fundraising</p>
<p>Melissa&#8217;s work in overseeing the project&#8217;s outreach and information pages on the Corporation for National Service&#8217;s information web site and dealing with prospective program VISTAs has been organized and efficient.  Through the late spring and summer, this extreme demands of this task involving communication not only with all VISTA applicants but with project supervisors can be appreciated by the fact that the CTC VISTA Project is the most popular in the entire CNS system.  A combination of work in both these arenas lead to a natural taking on of project-wide development work involving support for Project VISTAs in numerous arenas, the most visible of which were her work in producing a VISTA-focused project newsletter (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/Newsletter</a>) and overseeing/coordinating the project&#8217;s joint VISTA-Supervisor Advisory Committee.  Along with her contributions to the monthly Boston-area VISTA meetings, serving on the &#8220;First Tuesday&#8221; television production team, filling the gaps and undertaking other initiatives for project support, Melissa&#8217;s leadership is generally recognized by both her peers and the project&nbsp;administration.</p>

                    <p>Derek has played a principal role in the planning and facilitation of the DigitalArt Youth Program, particularly in regard to working with youth ages 10-18. He developed and implemented multimedia activities for participants, including extra-curricular activities such as field trips and showcases around the city. At the same time he has produced several multimedia projects that have been used to educate people about the benefits of joining BNN. Also, he assists in helping BNN members produce digital video programs for the&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p>He created a web site for the BNN DigitalArt Youth Program and played a major role in updating and maintaining it: <a href="http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm" title="http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm">http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm</a>.  He also takes the lead in regard to developing content for programs at the BNN Multimedia Center, including digital video production for PSAs and multimedia presentations that are seen by BNN members and Boston public access TV&nbsp;viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to his major project activities, Derek has been more than willing to attend and participate in several center-related training sessions for community media and technology centers in the northeast region as well presenting at youth fairs and conferences.  Near the end of his assignment, Derek contributed to the monthly First Tuesday TV/Web program produced by the Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative and he continued to work with CBC and BNN for several months after his assignment&nbsp;ended.</p>

                    <p>Scott came to BNN in September 2002.  He quickly became a valuable member of the BNN team, assisting with Ed/Out projects that promote BNN services, teaching video production, assisting members with non-linear editing, troubleshooting edit equipment, and producing public service announcements.  Scott has raised the production standards of BNN with his excellent editing and shooting skills.  He has also assisted with print promotions such as newsletters and&nbsp;flyers.</p>
<p>Due to Scott’s excellent production capabilities he was able to complete a number of PSAs, instructional videos, and community based programs for BNN.  Such programs included the 10 part series &#8220;Sister Talk 2,&#8221; a program aimed at African American women to raise awareness of cardiovascular health.  Scott assisted Barbara Barrow-Murray, BNN’s Roxbury Studio Manager, with editing the series.  Scott also played a large role in helping to modernize the look of the channel, creating promotional spots, and helping to improve the channel’s&nbsp;graphics.</p>

                    <p>Russell has worked directly with two technology workshops; one for younger children and one for the targeted youth aged 13-20 (7 participants).  In the latter, he was directly involved in the recruitment effort and in both programs worked closely with the instructors to enhance their&nbsp;effectiveness.  </p>
<p>Russell set up a digital video workstation (donated via MATV) and taught himself the iMovie software, working directly with the youth on the video they produced.  He has taught himself a web design program (TrellixWeb) and has been teaching youth in the Center on an ongoing basis.  We plan to continue the video course with the first group as well as offer the program to other&nbsp;youth.</p>

                    <p>Russell has engaged with youth in the target population to determine their goals, desires, issues, etc. to aid in planning for future programs.  His approachability makes him very accessible to any age group, which has enhanced his ability to engage and retain the interest of a small core in the target age group (youth aged 13-20).   While that core remains small (7-15), it is a large step for this organization.  We also have a number of youth who are just approaching the target age group, and they are already engaged in activities at the Center, including those that Russell has initiated.  We are confident that, rather than lose them as has happened in the past, we will retain them in our&nbsp;programs.</p>

                    <p>Byte Back needs VISTA assistance to meet the following goals:<br />
1) Better community service through better information and outreach:  VISTA workers will assist us with Community Mapping and community Outreach to determine modifications to services at existing CTC’s and the location of additional CTC’s<br />
2) Definition and documentation of the methods, the curriculum, and the effectiveness of the Byte Back model, the Technology Expert Organization (TEO), so that others may benefit from this success.<br />
3) Establishing a sustainability program so that Byte Back is not reliant on grants for continued existence and&nbsp;service.”</p>

                    <p>While actual canvassing of the local neighborhood was fruitful for relationships in our home neighborhood, networking with other organizations was more effective when we were exploring territory that was new to us. In St Phillip the Evangelist Church in South East we installed a computer lab with their donated computers and are running their computer training program. At Shaw Ministries we provided information that assists them to make cost effective decisions about use of space and purchase of materials. At World Mission Extension Center we provided computers and set up a lab and provided Junior Internship training for their Junior Councilors so that they could assist in camp and after school&nbsp;programs.</p>

                    <p>BPSOS’s project ACCESS, Access to Computers for Community Empowerment, Support and Services, hopes to improve English fluency and the acquisition of computer skills in the low-income community. During year one the VISTA member will work on the following&nbsp;tasks:</p>
<p>1. Work with community groups to identify youth needing the service and mobilize their participation in the program.<br />
2. Set up neighborhood-based classes. This involves identification of additional resources to support these classes (such as donated computers, text books, class space, supplies).<br />
3. Teach ESL and computer classes. This will include tailoring existing class materials to the needs of the target population.<br />
4. Recruit, train, and coordinate volunteers to serve as instructors and mentors.<br />
5. Encourage parents to take part in the education of their&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>During year 2 the VISTA goals were the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p>Goal 1:  Establish new CTC<br />
Goal 2:  After-school activities for youth<br />
Goal 3:  Community outreach<br />
Goal 4:  Community&nbsp;events</p>
