                    <p>CMAP, Community Media Access Partnership, is a non-profit tax-exempt public, education, and government public access television station and community media center that serves Gilroy, Hollister, and San Juan&nbsp;Bautista.</p>
<p>Our mission is to train residents in using CMAP&#8217;s video production equipment so that they can produce non-commercial community-based television programs to be seen on CMAP&#8217;s local access cable channels and live and archived via the web at <a href="http://www.cmap.tv" title="www.cmap.tv">www.cmap.tv</a>.</p>
<p>CMAP provides locally relevant community content on five cable channels. CMAP also offers free technology and video production training, camera equipment, editing suites and a television studio for use by community&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>Access Monterey Peninsula&#8217;s (AMP) mission is to enable local non-commercial media programming which benefits the residents of Monterey County through access to media tools, training, distribution channels and local&nbsp;facilities.</p>

                    <p>Project&nbsp;Details</p>
<p>AMP and CMAP have identified potential collaborations which would leverage opportunities for community engagement and capacity building locally and regionally due to the combined strengths and geographic proximity of these organizations as well as their fiscal need to&nbsp;collaborate.</p>
<p>1. Conduct Community Needs Assessment and organizational research to identify new opportunities for collaboration in the areas of infrastructure, technology, marketing, staffing and community products and services at each community media center.<br />
a. Report to Executive Directors on the Community Needs Assessment&nbsp;Results</p>
<p>2. Out of the results from the Community Needs Assessment, work with AMP and CMAP staff to develop collaborative approaches and regional coordination to implement/integrate media education programs, curriculum and outreach, marketing and social media campaigns, and technology&nbsp;automation.</p>
<p>3. Identify potential partners and funders to sustain the coordination of the regional&nbsp;efforts</p>
<p>Project Goals <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Outcomes<br />
This project will generate capacity-building opportunities for two community media centers, AMP and CMAP, through&nbsp;generating:</p>
<p>&#8211;Greater resources through researching and integrating opportunities to increase available and future resources (financial, technical, human, and physical) available to both organizations through consolidation and collaboration for outreach, funding, new fee-based technology, marketing and video production services for non-profits, education, and local&nbsp;residents.</p>
<p>&#8211;Greater efficiency through consolidating existing technology and utilizing new open source tools for use by both stations to create automation, engage members, and distribute local video content through social media networks, streaming live video, and by creating centralized, more accessible community media resources in two&nbsp;regions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Greater effectiveness by enabling broader outreach/marketing, sharing curriculum and staff, increasing technology efficiency and greater fundraising capacity to achieve current and future fiscal sustainability for each&nbsp;organization</p>
<p>Program Need<br />
-Organizations are technology-focused with room to grow<br />
-Impending financial crisis to traditional funding sources is forcing innovation<br />
-Initial collaboration has highlighted the increased need for potential regional consolidation with regard to technology, finances and&nbsp;marketing</p>
<p>The financial realities facing community media centers nationwide are sobering. AMP and CMAP currently receive 88% of their funding through local cable TV franchise&nbsp;agreements.</p>
<p>A new state-wide cable franchising law (DIVCA) was adopted in 2006 ending local cable franchises in favor of statewide franchising. Both AMP and CMAP have ended or will end their local franchise agreement with their respective cable operators in 2009, leaving their financial futures uncertain and requiring decreased&nbsp;budgets.</p>
<p>This situation calls for drastic budget cuts, (75% of operating costs) and innovative thinking by community media centers, including new ways to adapt to the funding cuts such as regional consolidation and collaboration between community media&nbsp;centers.</p>
<p>Communities throughout the state are losing their public access cable services as local governments in fiscal crisis choose to re-appropriate all or the majority of their cable franchise&nbsp;fees.</p>
<p>The rapid pace of technological change is another key challenge. Both AMP and CMAP have begun to build a foundation for emerging technologies to prepare for these new opportunities to shift the community media model. Each has developed different technology efficiencies that could be merged for greater capacity building and to leverage future revenue opportunities. New open source tools are available to streamline and automate public access systems. In collaboration, these two stations could together implement new tools and strategies to adapt, survive and thrive during these economic and technological&nbsp;changes.</p>
<p>While each station provides excellent community media resources, neither station has organizational history to access community funding commensurate with the services&nbsp;provided.</p>
<p>To move away from a government-subsidized model to a community-supported model with new revenue streams, community media organizations need to consolidate resources, technology and outreach to maximize their ability to serve their communities. This project will research and implement a new model for community&nbsp;media.</p>

                    Best practices for community media centers:

Currently many media centers share the same challenges as AMP and CMAP. These two organizations are well-positioned within the community media national movement to share the process of regional collaboration and best practices with other community media centers, media arts organizations, CTCs and related non-profits.        </div>

The VISTA will work with CMAP&#8217;s Executive Director Kathy Bisbee to increase outreach to regional media centers, continue collaborative efforts with existing partners created during the first VITSA year and implement new technology, marketing and fundraising strategies with both current and emerging collaborative&nbsp;partners. </p>
<p>To fulfill this role, the VISTA will be required to coordinate monthly conference calls and regional meetups; utilize social media tools and Web 2.0 technologies as effectively avenues of communication and education modules between centers; define the roles of each media center in collaborative efforts; schedule site visits to each center, document conversations between centers and determine best practices; identify thought leaders and innovators within the industry; and incorporate new insights into the existing cookbook for regional&nbsp;collaboration.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>With the help of our first-year DASC member, we have expanded collaborations with other community media centers in the state and region, sharing technology, marketing, educational content and curriculum to media centers and non-profit organizations.<br />
-Increased communication with between two media centers to enable collaboration on several key projects including growing capacity of both organizations to fundraise, use technology tools, and manage staff and members.<br />
-Increased communication enabling the implementation of new technology resources, including access to other center&#8217;s technical staff, new equipment for CMAP&#8217;s institutional network and engineering expertise from other centers.<br />
-Increased CMAP&#8217;s ability to fundraise/build community awareness<br />
-Helped to initiate new strategies to develop and share community content between&nbsp;centers.</p>
<p>Based on the success of the first year of this project, we are now in the second year, expanding to a statewide collaboration. For the first year, both organizations expanded our capacity through seeing the need to hire staff for fundraising, collaborated on grants that resulted in funding and staffing, and created an expanded collaboration program into our region. After the second year, we hope that agencies will work together regularly to continue this&nbsp;collaboration.</p>
<p>Our VISTA accomplished all of what was included in our project, but also helped to write grants for the organizations and learned development skills. He was hired by one of the media centers after the project to be a development assistant. He also became involved in developing the second year plan for our expanded&nbsp;collaboration.</p>
