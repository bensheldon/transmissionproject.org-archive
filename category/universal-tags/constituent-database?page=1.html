                    <p>This VISTA member, in their capacity as outreach assistant, would serve to bring new organizations and communities in to work with QUQ. The role of outreach assistant would be valuable experience for the VISTA member in networking, community organizing and learning about the community that she/he would be working and living in. It involves calling people, talking to them, sending them information by email, asking them to come to a meeting and to tour our&nbsp;studios.</p>
<p>The VISTA member would keep accurate records of contacts and the process of recruitment, as well as the steps and the results of fundraising efforts. These records would be used for the manual that would be developed in conjunction with the executive&nbsp;director.</p>

                    <p>Some main areas that Erica helped to develop and expand are: Volunteer recruitment/outreach, Partnership Expansion/Outreach, and Fundraising&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>Volunteer outreach: Erica has set up an entire program of recruitment of volunteers. As a result we had as many as 19 volunteer interns at one time at our facility during the fall, spring and summer months. The recruitment efforts targeted local universities and high schools. The success was due to setting up face to face meetings as well as using Craig&#8217;s List, social media and e-newsletter contact. This was done in conjunction with the Executive&nbsp;Director. </p>
<p>Partnership Outreach: Erica also worked on setting up partnerships with the Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau, Media Literacy Project, The Alibi (local weekly newspaper), Enlace Comunitario, SWOP, KUNM Youth Radio, Albuquerque Film Festival, SW Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Taos Shortz Film Festival, Experimental Cinema Film Festival, New Mexico Daily Lobo, Public Service Media Project, NM Film Office, NM Thunderbirds, CitizenSchools, and the creation of an accredited production class through the University of New Mexico Continuing Education&nbsp;department. </p>
<p>Fundraising Outreach: Erica worked on many small scale and large scale fundraising efforts throughout the year. Some examples of these efforts are: &#8220;Benefit Night&#8221; fundraisers being help at T.G.I.Friday and Fuddruckers, a &#8220;TV Dinner&#8221; benefit event, a concert event at a local venue, and the development of a monthly media industry networking event held at a local restaurant. Other areas have included working alongside the Executive Director on research for and preparation of grants and foundation money. Examples of this assistance was the working on a letter of inquiry for the Glaser Foundation which focused on Independent Media projects. We pitched the creation of a youth-focused journalism and mentorship program. A letter of inquiry into the MacArthur Foundation, regarding the same project. The creation of a profile in multiple local community foundations. She did extensive research and compiling together of regional, state-wide, and national grants and foundations that could be potential sources for income. Erica also helped Steve Ranieri with researching and preparing the application for a grant through the McCune Foundation, a local foundation here in New&nbsp;Mexico. </p>
<p>Other general outreach efforts that Erica engaged in were attending various local outreach events, such as: NM Film and Media Day, Digital Arts Conference, NM Film conference, SW Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Fiery Foods Show, and other events where the positive image of our organization was represented. All of these efforts were tracked, documented, and written into a manual titled &#8220;How to Outreach: a Resource Guide for Quote Unquote.&#8221; This resource will be left behind for future staff and VISTAs to refer back to for&nbsp;guidance.</p>
<p>Two other projects Erica worked on were the transitioning of the paper newsletter to the electronic newsletter and the transitioning of the Dreamweaver based website to a user-friendly, more efficient website through the Grassroots.org services. It developed through the need of better organizational efficiency. There was an indication that some staff had additional responsibilities that were taking them away from their actual work. With Erica noticing this, she suggested making these two main transitions as a means to alleviate extra work from staff (printing of newsletters, mailing them, updating the website using software that requires skills) and to build a more sustainable&nbsp;infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>The Development <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Communications project would entail directing a fundamental change in fundraising policy, moving Prometheus towards a more grassroots fundraising strategy. This project would also include developing and maintaining systems for Prometheus’ donor and paid technical service relationships. It also entails creating communications tools, such as a regular and targeted donor appeal, for soliciting a broad base of financial support from those that access our&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>Goal 1: Help build and solidify Prometheus&#8217; ability to engage community radio stations and community radio supporters in opportunities to support Prometheus financially and in a regular and sustainable&nbsp;fashion.</p>
<p>Goal 2: Create a more sustainable source of funding by developing technical services and products that Prometheus can offer for a&nbsp;fee.</p>

                    <p>Ian’s work as been essential at building the capacity of the organization at a key time of growth and transformation of&nbsp;Prometheus. </p>
<p>Towards goal #1 of increasing regular, constituent contact, Ian has: shepherded the development of a new database merging 4 into one, developed a system for maintenance, trained all staff, coordinated a monthly eNewsletter, coordinated an annual mail appeal, implemented CiviEvent for pre-registration for events, and implemented a paper sign up sheet system for events. As a result, our database list grew by 7,456 new contacts, including over 600 from the US Social Forum where Ian’s sign up system was first used. We now have over 1000 facebook fans who receive regular updates thanks to Ian’s merging of our email, web, and facebook communications. A database consultant worked with Ian to build the CiviCRM database after which he largely implemented the above with input from Prometheus collective&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>Towards goal #2 of building grassroots fundraising support, Ian has helped develop a work plan and donation calendar for the Development Team which has guided our work throughout the year and made reporting on progress much easier. He designed and launched our new Sustaining Funders program. He also designed and launched out new major donor program by identifying potential donors and inviting them to key events and creating a donor packet. Ian assisted in writing a number of grants and grant reports for Prometheus, helping to gather statistics on the effectiveness of our programs and the demographics of our constituents. He did these in conjunction with our Development&nbsp;Director. </p>
<p>Towards goal #3 of developing web donor tools, Ian has built a number of custom donation interfaces to our new database and build contact and other forms on our website. As a result, the new website will integrate seamlessly with our database, cutting out costly duplication of data. We can now track what appeal or route online donations come from and better assess the success of our specific fundraising efforts. Ian was trained by our web developer to create these&nbsp;forms.</p>

                    <p>In short, Nathan is helping us build the sustainability to continue all of UTEC&#8217;s mission. He has spent much focus on building systems (i.e. donor recognition systems) so that his work will last longer than his immediate 1-year impact. he produced our first ever annual report!! And, he has excited the entire development departament about the possibilities inherent in individual donor fundraising through his infectious excitement about such&nbsp;fundraising.</p>

                    <p>Nathan has done an excellent job in his role as a VISTA here at UTEC! He  took on a leading role in coordinating UTEC&#8217;s most comprehensive and successfull fundraiser to date. He has contributed immensely by helping us organize and develop a new online grants database (which I strongly believe will be a model for other nonprofits on how to best integrate technology into their development work). He has written and won grants.   He has created a well organized foundation/donor recognition system that has substantially improved our capacity for relationship building with funders. And he has provided much excitement around the development of a new individual donor organization process. I have been very pleased with Nathan&#8217;s work (this being his first time in a development position as this) and would rehire him in a&nbsp;minute.</p>

                    <p>Nathan took a leading role in coordinating all aspects of our first major fundraiser. With our Dvelopment Director out sick for some time during this period, he was sometimes running this without a ton of support. He took this as a challenge and semed to be invigorated by the challenge&#8230; never pessimistic or overwhelmed by stress. In the end, we had nearly 200 guests attend and profited nearly $10,000. Moreover, all those who attended coninue today to talk about how professional and well orchestrated it was. Ultimately, Nathan was able to establish the inception of what will now be the annual fundraiser event for UTEC&#8230;.each year building upon the success of all his work this past&nbsp;year.</p>

                    <p>As the purpose of the AmeriCorps*VISTA program is to provide useful outreach to local communities, our participants echoed their sentiment through visible outreach and service projects. One example I am reminded of was the special PBS viewing of “Every Mother’s Son,” coordinated by Mr. Bentinez. The event called for local law enforcement agents and community members to come together in support of the idea of social change, justice and a forum for communication and healing. This project used the power of media and the passion of human nature to discuss the realities of police brutality in New York City. This event is also an example of a sustainable solution effort and the ability of change.<br />

                    <p>Jeff has set up an exchange server for the UTEC network.  This has helped staff better communicate with one another, and made accountability, reporting, and assigning tasks simpler and quicker, in order to better achieve our mission.   Jeff is making progress with his project to update the teen log-in database which will keep track of interactions of senior staff with all UTEC teen members.  Jeff has made a presentation and training manual on how to use the teen log-in database, and exchange servers.   Jeff has been working consistently with the CSL (on site once per week) to continue to enhance UTEC&#8217;s tecnhical capabilities.  Some of the projects he is working on in this regard are enhancing UTEC&#8217;s fundraising database, organizing the UTEC listserve, and his teen log-in database and exchange server projects.   Jeff is still preparing equipment to kick off the next wave of computer repair classes at UTEC, which will begin when UTEC officially opens our new building this&nbsp;spring.</p>
