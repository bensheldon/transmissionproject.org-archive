 <title>FUTURE OF MUSIC COALITION PRESENTS D.C. POLICY DAY 2010</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/05/future-of-music-coalition-presents-dc-policy-day-2010</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;National research, education and advocacy nonprofit Future of Music Coalition is pleased to announce its upcoming &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; Policy Day, which takes place at New America Foundation in Washington, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; on May 4,&amp;nbsp;2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has already seen a host of policy developments that will affect the entire music ecosystem — from network neutrality and the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;’s authority to regulate the internet to international copyright concerns to the impact of health care reform on the music community. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; Policy Day 2010 will bring these issues into focus through informed presentations and panel discussions. A live webcast will bring the conversation to a global audience of artists, academics, industry professionals, journalists, music fans and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics to be covered include the hotly debated Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACTA&lt;/span&gt;), the recent Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger, efforts to preserve an open internet and the health insurance landscape for musicians. Policy Day 2010 will also examine how the creative industries are faring under current Washington leadership as we head into a new election&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Newspaper Article: Calling Home and Losing Minutes</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/resources/2009/7/newspaper-article-calling-home-and-losing-minutes</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VISTA&lt;/span&gt; member Kris Rios serving at People&amp;#8217;s Production House in New York, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/Tech/20090615/19/2938&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Gotham Gazette&lt;/em&gt; (New York City News and Policy) about the difficulties and costs experienced by those trying to stay in touch with family and loved ones. This article discusses challenges people using calling cards faced, notes pending regulation and law changes, and provides consumer&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In addition to generic consumer protection websites like fraud.org, the National Consumers League&amp;#8217;s online fraud center, New Yorkers can turn to the New York City Department of Consumers Affairs. A spokesperson for department said that because telecommunications companies are regulated at the federal and state level, the city does not require calling card businesses to hold Department of Consumer Affairs licenses. Still, the agency does document and forward local complaints against calling card services to federal authorities. Consumers who think they have been scammed, they can file complaints by calling 311 or by going to the consumer affairs website&amp;nbsp;website.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
