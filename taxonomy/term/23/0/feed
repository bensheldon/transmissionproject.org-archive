 <title>Horizontal Learning and Urban Poverty</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2009/6/horizontal-learning-and-urban-poverty</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a fascinating of example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sdinet.co.za/ritual/exchanges/&quot;&gt;networked-learning practice from Shack/Slum Dwellers International (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDI&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;They have developed peer-to-peer learning and sharing systems to spread community developed solutions &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; geographically dispersed urban environments. (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.network-centricadvocacy.net/2009/06/more-network-wisdom-from-shackslum-dwellers-international.html&quot;&gt;NetCentric Advocacy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Horizontal exchange, then, is the primary learning strategy of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDI&lt;/span&gt;. Participants within the savings networks learn best from each other - when one savings group has initiated a successful income-generating project or has replanned a settlement or has built a toilet block, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDI&lt;/span&gt; enables groups to come together and learn from intra-network achievements. The community exchange process builds upon the logic of &amp;#8216;doing is knowing&amp;#8217; and helps to develop a collective vision. As savers travel from Khayelitsha to Greenpoint or Nairobi to Colombo, the network is unified and strengthened - not only at a street level but between towns, regions and provinces, and nation-states. In this way, locally appropriate ideas get transfered into the global millieu through dialogue amongst slumdweller&amp;nbsp;partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community-to-community exchanges allow participants to see themselves and their peers as experts, thereby breaking isolation to create a unified voice of the urban poor, reclaiming sites of knowledge that have frequently been co-opted by professionals, and strengthening solidarity to increase critical mass. The pool of knowledge generated through exchange programmes becomes a collective asset of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDI&lt;/span&gt; network - so that when slumdwellers meet with external actors to debate development policies, they can draw from international examples, forcing government and other stakeholders to&amp;nbsp;listen.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a connector of different organizational communications&amp;#8211;media, arts, technology, broadcasting and movement building&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s great to see the same practices we trade in used to empower people directly. &lt;strong&gt;Doing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Knowing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
