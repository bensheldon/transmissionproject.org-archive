                    <p>Media Alliance was founded in 1977 to address common needs of nonprofit organizations providing electronic media programs and services to artists, organizations and the general public in areas including, but not limited to, production, distribution, exhibition, research, preservation, appreciation, and to further development of this field. Media Alliance also has a mandate to sponsor and encourage cultural, and educational activities among media organizations, artists, and the general public, by conducting research, by gathering information, by organizing and disseminating information among the membership, by effectively communicating and cooperating with film organizations and other groups, independent producers, funding sources, and the general public, by responding to issues of concern to the field, by public information programs, and by administering&nbsp;property.</p>
<p>The Sanctuary has developed rapidly as an engaged member of our economically disadvantaged neighborhood, supporting desperately needed independent local voices through workshops, peer training, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> internships. We’ve offered media arts, education, production and literacy programs to local groups directly engaged in poverty-related activities, including: Missing Link Street Ministry, North Central Communities That Care, AME Zion, NAACP, Troy Public Schools, the ARK, Troy Bike Rescue, 518 Positive Reinforcement, Nutrition Consortium of NY, NY Civil Liberties Union, TAP, W.D.I. and Independent Living Center. This season our Youth Media Sanctuary project includes:<br />
&#8211; &#8220;Children Having Children,&#8221; directed by a 22 year old mother of an 8 year old<br />
&#8211;“Gangs and My Family,” directed by a young man sharing first person perspective of fantasies and realities of gang culture.<br />
&#8211;“Bike Rodeo” with safety education, arts and crafts projects<br />
&#8211;Youth Media Showcase<br />
&#8211;Animation workshop<br />

                    <p>In its tenth year, the Urbana Champaign Independent Media Center (UCIMC) is a grassroots organization committed to using media production and distribution as tools for promoting social and economic justice. The UCIMC fosters the creation and distribution of media, art, and narratives emphasizing underrepresented voices and perspectives, and promotes empowerment and expression through media and arts education. To this end, we own and operate a Community Media and Arts Center located in the historic post office building in downtown Urbana, Illinois. The Center includes a radio station, media production studios, a performance venue, art gallery, artist in residence studios, a library, public access computer labs, bike repair center, and meeting spaces. The UCIMC runs a 24/7 low power radio station, publishes a monthly newspaper, operates a daily website, and hosts numerous community listservs, all freely available to the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>The UCIMC is strongly supported by and embedded in communities with little access mainstream media. The roots of poverty lay in a lack of access to participation in the decisions that affect one&#8217;s life, including the decisions about the allocation of resources and power. The UCIMC works to eradicate poverty through empowering residents to &#8220;become the media&#8221; - amplifying unheard voices, inspiring and uniting those who work for change, and helping to shift and reframe public discourse. For example, residents pressing for the clean up of a toxic waste site in their neighborhood used UCIMC-facilitated investigative journalism and organizing to get the city and EPA involved in cleaning the site.Over 44,000 free books have been shipped to Illinois prisoners through UCIMC&#8217;s Books to Prisoners program. The UCIMC is an official Community Technology Center in Illinois and is a key partner in our community&#8217;s NTIA application that was just awarded $22.5 million for broadband&nbsp;infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>WSLR-LP is an innovative, listener-supported, non-profit, non-commercial FM radio station dedicated to serving the Sarasota&nbsp;community. </p>
<p>WSLR features locally produced programming and events that offer cultural, artistic, and political perspectives currently underrepresented in the media. Our goal is to inform and empower listeners to play an active role in WSLR and in their&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>WSLR’s programming promotes equality, peace, sustainability, democracy, and social and economic&nbsp;justice. </p>
<p>We have over 100 community volunteers programming at the station. Many of our programmers are low-income, currently unemployed, and in danger of losing their homes. A number of radio programs serve the interests of traditionally underserved communities in our area, including “Newtown and Beyond”, “Recovery Radio” and “Perspectives”. We offer opportunities to ex-felons and those who need community service hours to satisfy their parole requirements. We strive to reach out to poor and homeless populations to give them a voice in their community. WSLR covers stories that other local news outlets do not. We have participated in the Homelessness Marathon for the past three years putting homeless people on the air to tell their stories. We also partner with All Faiths Food Bank to collect canned goods for hungry&nbsp;families.</p>

                    <p>Local voices through community media – engage, connect,&nbsp;educate. </p>
<p>Our Vision (as outlined in the Strategic Plan) is to establish Access Humboldt (AH) as an innovative, self-sustaining and trusted media resource for residents of Humboldt County, to reach diverse community members who will utilize local media access resources to engage in meaningful conversations that increase participation in civic life, to support and enhance digital media production as a growing industry that supports a continually improving quality of life, and to enable North Coast residents to be among the most media literate people in the world – sharing new ideas and advanced methods to empower local voices for significant positive impact on&nbsp;society.</p>
<p>AH is committed to providing access to communication tools for all residents of Humboldt County regardless of geography, income or skill level. This principle overrides all of the programs of AH. These programs include the operation of four television channels on the local cable line-up, production equipment <span class="amp">&amp;</span> facility use for creation of digital media, public computers for development and distribution of digital media, and classes <span class="amp">&amp;</span> workshops in the creation, development, distribution and archiving of digital&nbsp;media. </p>
<p>AH is a founding partner in Digital Pathways, a digital media training project committed to developing sustainable training, skill-sharing and workforce development services in collaboration with the Bay Area Video Coalition, the County Workforce Investment Board, the Northern California Indian Development Council and local education institutions.

                    <p>CMAP, Community Media Access Partnership, is a non-profit tax-exempt public, education, and government public access television station and community media center that serves Gilroy, Hollister, and San Juan&nbsp;Bautista.</p>
<p>Our mission is to train residents in using CMAP&#8217;s video production equipment so that they can produce non-commercial community-based television programs to be seen on CMAP&#8217;s local access cable channels and live and archived via the web at <a href="http://www.cmap.tv" title="www.cmap.tv">www.cmap.tv</a>.</p>
<p>CMAP provides locally relevant community content on five cable channels. CMAP also offers free technology and video production training, camera equipment, editing suites and a television studio for use by community&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>Access Monterey Peninsula&#8217;s (AMP) mission is to enable local non-commercial media programming which benefits the residents of Monterey County through access to media tools, training, distribution channels and local&nbsp;facilities.</p>

                    <p>Project&nbsp;Details</p>
<p>AMP and CMAP have identified potential collaborations which would leverage opportunities for community engagement and capacity building locally and regionally due to the combined strengths and geographic proximity of these organizations as well as their fiscal need to&nbsp;collaborate.</p>
<p>1. Conduct Community Needs Assessment and organizational research to identify new opportunities for collaboration in the areas of infrastructure, technology, marketing, staffing and community products and services at each community media center.<br />
a. Report to Executive Directors on the Community Needs Assessment&nbsp;Results</p>
<p>2. Out of the results from the Community Needs Assessment, work with AMP and CMAP staff to develop collaborative approaches and regional coordination to implement/integrate media education programs, curriculum and outreach, marketing and social media campaigns, and technology&nbsp;automation.</p>
<p>3. Identify potential partners and funders to sustain the coordination of the regional&nbsp;efforts</p>
<p>Project Goals <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Outcomes<br />
This project will generate capacity-building opportunities for two community media centers, AMP and CMAP, through&nbsp;generating:</p>
<p>&#8211;Greater resources through researching and integrating opportunities to increase available and future resources (financial, technical, human, and physical) available to both organizations through consolidation and collaboration for outreach, funding, new fee-based technology, marketing and video production services for non-profits, education, and local&nbsp;residents.</p>
<p>&#8211;Greater efficiency through consolidating existing technology and utilizing new open source tools for use by both stations to create automation, engage members, and distribute local video content through social media networks, streaming live video, and by creating centralized, more accessible community media resources in two&nbsp;regions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Greater effectiveness by enabling broader outreach/marketing, sharing curriculum and staff, increasing technology efficiency and greater fundraising capacity to achieve current and future fiscal sustainability for each&nbsp;organization</p>
<p>Program Need<br />
-Organizations are technology-focused with room to grow<br />
-Impending financial crisis to traditional funding sources is forcing innovation<br />
-Initial collaboration has highlighted the increased need for potential regional consolidation with regard to technology, finances and&nbsp;marketing</p>
<p>The financial realities facing community media centers nationwide are sobering. AMP and CMAP currently receive 88% of their funding through local cable TV franchise&nbsp;agreements.</p>
<p>A new state-wide cable franchising law (DIVCA) was adopted in 2006 ending local cable franchises in favor of statewide franchising. Both AMP and CMAP have ended or will end their local franchise agreement with their respective cable operators in 2009, leaving their financial futures uncertain and requiring decreased&nbsp;budgets.</p>
<p>This situation calls for drastic budget cuts, (75% of operating costs) and innovative thinking by community media centers, including new ways to adapt to the funding cuts such as regional consolidation and collaboration between community media&nbsp;centers.</p>
<p>Communities throughout the state are losing their public access cable services as local governments in fiscal crisis choose to re-appropriate all or the majority of their cable franchise&nbsp;fees.</p>
<p>The rapid pace of technological change is another key challenge. Both AMP and CMAP have begun to build a foundation for emerging technologies to prepare for these new opportunities to shift the community media model. Each has developed different technology efficiencies that could be merged for greater capacity building and to leverage future revenue opportunities. New open source tools are available to streamline and automate public access systems. In collaboration, these two stations could together implement new tools and strategies to adapt, survive and thrive during these economic and technological&nbsp;changes.</p>
<p>While each station provides excellent community media resources, neither station has organizational history to access community funding commensurate with the services&nbsp;provided.</p>
<p>To move away from a government-subsidized model to a community-supported model with new revenue streams, community media organizations need to consolidate resources, technology and outreach to maximize their ability to serve their communities. This project will research and implement a new model for community&nbsp;media.</p>

                    Best practices for community media centers:

Currently many media centers share the same challenges as AMP and CMAP. These two organizations are well-positioned within the community media national movement to share the process of regional collaboration and best practices with other community media centers, media arts organizations, CTCs and related non-profits.        </div>
