                    <p>HOLA&#8217;s youth attend overburdened inner city schools, live in communities that are heavily impacted by illegal drug trafficking and gang violence and many children are hindered by poverty and immigration&nbsp;status. </p>
<p>VISION<br />
Hundreds of underserved children are traveling across one end of a beautiful green park with backpacks and musical instruments or athletics gear, through families perched under trees on blankets reading a book or painting in the middle of this community campus while others play sports, on their way to another green building met by inspirational teachers, coaches, parents and mentors, everyone is coming together and sharing, everyone is&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p>One of LA’s best kept secrets started in a church gym and almost 20 years later has grown into a vibrant community oasis for thousands of inner-city youth.  HOLA is a thriving center that serves the Rampart community with programs in academics, the arts and athletics.  The organization is unique in the quality of instruction and individual attention it provides to youth ages 6 to&nbsp;19.</p>
<p>HOLA’s campus, located in and around Lafayette Park, is a home away from home for hundreds of kids.  They know that they will get the help they need from HOLA’s professional staff and highly talented volunteers.  Through HOLA’s extensive volunteer program, the youth are exposed to a wide array of experts including artists, executives, chefs, athletes, engineers, and counselors who truly commit themselves to providing programs of the highest quality, giving kids the best chance to become successful in&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Through HOLA’s unique partnership with the LA City Recreation and Parks Department, students living in poverty have much needed green space – a state of the art field turf soccer field, outdoor basketball courts, and a brand new gym that is currently under construction.*  Best of all, these facilities are safe spaces, open year round, truly offering the youth of the community an alternative to hanging out on the&nbsp;streets.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>HOLA’s AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, Ashley Cross, has been an amazing addition to Heart of Los Angeles Youth (HOLA). You need only visit our new and improved website to see the many ways that she has made a tremendous impact upon the organization.  At <a href="http://www.heartofla.org" title="www.heartofla.org">www.heartofla.org</a> you will see updated stories and press releases which Ashley designed and published.  She also designed and formatted a link for point of donation opportunities, as well as a merchandizing page featuring HOLA cards designed by our youth.  HOLA has received close to $3,000 in donations through our website to date, which funds can be directly attributed to Ashley’s efforts.  We also received a $50,000 grant that came through our new and improved site. Please take a look at the home page and the articles included on the site, which Ashley was responsible for designing and formatting.  Ashley was able to recreate on our web site the entire article about HOLA, including photographs, which was published in “La Opinion”.  She was responsible for creating the Special Events page and many of the stories and pictures throughout the site.  At the same time, we have been able to hard copies of the PDF articles from the web site to form an integral part of HOLA’s press packet.  Ashley’s contribution to the HOLA website is only one very critical part of how she&#8217;s expanded the capacity for our&nbsp;organization.  </p>
<p>Ashley succeeded in refurbishing the 30 laptops ahead of schedule, but the organization encountered some unforeseen obstacles in procuring battery packs, a wireless router, wireless cards, and most importantly, a space to accommodate the Mobile Lab Project.  Thanks to Ashley’s research, these were obtained during the last quarter of her term. While these challenges were being addressed, we added the new goal of increasing the capacity of HOLA’s development office through the overall improvement of the website, which Ashley undertook with great efficiency and&nbsp;success. </p>
<p>The Mobile Lab Project is now slated to be unveiled in March or April of 2006, a successful culmination of Ashley’s research and development efforts.  Batteries, cards and a router have been obtained, and funds have been secured for the build-out of the new Teen&nbsp;Center.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Ashley’s ability to accomplish tasks quickly has greatly enhanced HOLA’s public image, giving a much-needed dynamic quality to the website, much to the organization’s benefit.  Because she finished the Mobile Laptop Project in such a timely manner, HOLA was able to gain additional financial support from national companies towards launching a new Teen Center.  Ashley successfully adapted to the new goals as they evolved during the year, and she was able to complete the tasks set out for her before the end of her contract.  Fortunately for Heart of Los Angeles Youth, Ashley’s next post will be as a full-time staff member.  She joined HOLA’s staff as the Bridges After School Manager and Volunteer Coordinator on September 19,&nbsp;2005.</p>

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
