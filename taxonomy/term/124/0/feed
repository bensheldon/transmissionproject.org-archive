 <title>FCC Broadband Workshop: Broadband Accessibility for People with Disabilities</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2009/10/fcc-broadband-workshop-broadband-accessibility-for-people-with-disabilities</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Barriers, Opportunities, and Policy Recommendations will continue the open discussion among the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; and all who have a stake in the future of broadband and its accessibility for people with disabilities, including the disability community, network and service providers, equipment manufacturers, and software producers, technologists, economists, academics, representatives from trade associations and non-profits, and representatives from tribal, local, state, and federal&amp;nbsp;governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this follow-up workshop is to clearly identify (i) accessibility and affordability barriers faced by people with disabilities in accessing broadband capabilities; (ii) opportunities that broadband can present for people with disabilities; and (iii) policy recommendations that will address the barriers to broadband for people with disabilities and maximize the opportunities related to broadband for people with&amp;nbsp;disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the panels, there will be exhibits of assistive technologies that are used by people with disabilities to access broadband technologies as well as universally designed mass market broadband technologies that can be used by people with&amp;nbsp;disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a reason they say pictures are worth a thousand words. Graphical depictions of data on your website can help your audience understand complex information and move them to take action.  Thanks to a set of newer, mostly free, online tools such as Google Docs Spreadsheet, ManyEyes, and Swivel Business, creating online charts has never been easier. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealware.org/tips/0910_onlinecharts.php&quot; title=&quot;http://www.idealware.org/tips/0910_onlinecharts.php&quot;&gt;http://www.idealware.org/tips/0910_onlinecharts.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
