<p>The Corps member will create mechanisms that youth can easily use to connect with other youth media organizations throughout the year. The Corps member will increase investment in youth media literacy by planning events (both virtual and physical) to engage the youth media community. Youth investment will also be increased through exposure to other youth media programs nationally and locally. The Corps member will also coordinate focus groups with constituents, national and youth media groups and Community Art Center alumni to help identify best practices in youth media&nbsp;curriculum.</p>

The Corps member will also play a critical role in reaching out to more economic justice groups who can advise us on key issues. We have been wanting to cultivate these relationships to deepen our beat, but have lacked the capacity to do so. The Community Engagement and Volunteer COordinator will play a vital role in our organization: managing volunteers, reaching out to grass roots economic justice organizations, and organizing events and house parties, with the support of other volunteers. They will deepen our networks among 3 major constituents: 1? Volunteers, 2) Donors, and 3) Grassroots&nbsp;Allies.</p>

To support the media center concept, the Corps member will gather information on the needs of the community, reach out to organizations/individuals to build partnerships to help meet these needs, determine what each organization has to offer and at what level they would like to participate. The Corps member will also assist in developing a marketing plan to familiarize the community with the new services/trainings/events that will be available at the media center. Working closely with the Station&#8217;s promotions committee, the Corps member will assist with organizing two fundraising events to build awareness and raise funds to support the center&#8217;s growth. A grant proposal for local funding will also be&nbsp;developed.</p>

<p>Morgan helped the San Diego Community Technology Coalition move from a very static website, to a drupal/civic space website which allows for staff to enter data in the site and for community  members to search a GIS based maps to find CTCs near them. He also helped to establish many community collaborations, in particular where SDCTC is now placed to help San Diego build it&#8217;s capacity for free wi-fi access in our underserved&nbsp;communities.</p>
<p>Morgan also helped set-up a new computer lab at our Youth Housing Project which serves 23 formerly homeless&nbsp;youth.</p>
<p>For SDCTC, Morgan brought together some of the more cutting edge technology advocates to our Annual Symposium and to several workshops put on throughout the year. He helped open the eyes of other Community Technology Centers to how they could use technology to advocate for their&nbsp;clients.</p>

                    <p>A VISTA will help coordinate the variety of content that supports the CTC VISTA Project and that the Project produces for the community media and technology fields. This position provides an excellent environment in which to develop professional editorial skills in various media. This VISTA will serve as Assistant Editor of the Community Technology&nbsp;Review</p>
<p>As specified in this year&#8217;s project basics (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/projectbasics.htm</a>), all organizations participating in the VISTA Project will be required to do some work in one of four areas (community networking, community organizing, technology assistance to nonprofits, and digital media for youth). Nationally known experts will be coordinating each of these areas. The Curriculum Coordinator will work with these experts to develop curricular material to be used for people with interest these areas and for the College&#8217;s Community Media and Technology&nbsp;program.</p>

                    <p>In her capacity as Assistant Editor of &#8220;The Community Technology Review&#8221; (<a href="http://www.comtechreview.org" title="www.comtechreview.org">www.comtechreview.org</a>), Danielle ably undertook a wide range of responsibilities including taking over the reins from the previous Associated Editor and completing all organizing and author communication already in the works, coordinating sections and writing a substantial number of articles for the fall issue.  She oversaw the development and production of the online version, dealt with university printing services in arranging for hard copy printings, and did author/contributor follow-up. Following this, she was helpfully involved in working with the Advisory Committee in undertaking future planning, and when the decision was made for the publication to go on hiatus and be replaced in the interim with the Project newsletter/report, she accepted oversight responsibility and published the first issue (see <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters">www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/newsletters</a>) in its entirety.  She has followed this up with taking primary responsbility for planning future issues for the remainder of the project year, including coordination with the Priority Area Coordinator materials, as that dovetails and integrates with her work with them in developing curricular material for the project that can be integrated with the College&#8217;s Community Media and Technology Program (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt" title="www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt</a>).  In addition to these things, she has proved to be a key and invaluable member of the project leadership team at office&nbsp;headquarters.</p>
<p>Danielle serves as liason between the Community Media and Technology Program curriculum building efforts and the VISTA project&#8217;s content focused learning groups. She has been extremely effective in working with faculty in curriculum design, making real connections between the field work of the VISTA&#8217;s and the CMT curriculum. She has also worked to assist me in the Tactical Media project, a project-based learning initiative of the program, in coordinating planning and research, presentations and communications flow for the project. She has also taken the leadership in creating and presenting a number of new media workshops, digital storytelling, for example. Along with her VISTA partner, she coordinated a digital media mini conference for students, faculty and staff.  Danielle has undertaken extensive curriculum research for a study on community media our program is doing in conjunction with the Benton Foundation, as well research for the development of future courses in the College of Public and Community service. Danielle has performed at a very high level of thoughtfulness and strategic insight. Danielle has made an enormous contribution to the CMT program&#8217;s&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>Danielle has quickly become an important part of the Project headquarters team. She has shown admirable persistence in her efforts to draw some useful &#8216;curriculum&#8217; from busy VISTAs and under-utilized &#8216;priority area coordinators.&#8217; I actually think that she has accomplished more in this area than she gives herself credit for&#8211; mostly through her exchanges with VISTAs in the field but also through her (and Shannon&#8217;s) efforts to get VISTAs involved in workshops and events related to the CMT program. She has in some sense become an unofficial VISTA leader through here extensive contact with VISTAs across the country. She has also done a good deal of evangelizing for the Project&#8211; a number of new organizations will be applying as a result of these efforts. She&#8217;s a gifted/natural-born communicator and that&#8217;s just so helpful in so many&nbsp;ways.</p>

                    <p>Roxanne helped plan and deliver the member acceptance letters, handbook, and Pre-Service Orientation.  She has answered many questions from the members on many topics related to their service, thus setting them up to accomplish our mission.  This includes 6 one-on-one, more in depth check ins with members, one regarding youth media.  She has helped plan and facilitate Corps Days where AmeriCorps Members participate in formal and informal training, speakers, workshops, field trips, etc.  She has prepared and delivered media literacy training with 2 AmeriCorps CTEP members for the statewide MLK Day AmeriCorps conference.  She and two AmeriCorps CTEP members prepared and delivered a technology literacy workshop for the All VISTA Conference (which she also helped coordinate with MN VISTA Leaders).  She has also moderated our online message board, created her own blog and encouraged member blogging.  Finally, she has been the advisor to two CTEP member committees, media and&nbsp;communications.</p>
<p>Roxanne has contributed to the ability of three CTEP sites to move beyond the &#8220;tech center as babysitter&#8221; mentality by assisting them to use technology resources to give youth a voice via digital media.  At SPNN, she has lent her media literacy mentoring to the youth department where teens are creating a TV program for a teen audience.  At the YWCA, she and Ken nelson provided a video submission opportunity to the staff and youth, and provided them with the curriculum, which allowed the youth to complete a video to submit.  At Intermedia Arts, she has assisted in the identification and securing of hardware and software to implement a digital media center, and complimented this with assisting in the curriculum development and program&nbsp;planning.</p>

We&#8217;ve also formulated the database staretgy, and a sustainability plan (still being refined and executed).  We&#8217;ve made an impact on the vision for the state community technology sector and we&#8217;ve launched a ring of websites in addition to the relaunch of our own site on a content managment system.  This makes generation of content much easier, and more easily shared.  Additionally we&#8217;ve put certain other webtools and communications infrastructure in place:  phplist for our ilctc Bulletin, webforms for feedback and hylafax for blast&nbsp;communications.</p>

                    <p>In short, Nathan is helping us build the sustainability to continue all of UTEC&#8217;s mission. He has spent much focus on building systems (i.e. donor recognition systems) so that his work will last longer than his immediate 1-year impact. he produced our first ever annual report!! And, he has excited the entire development departament about the possibilities inherent in individual donor fundraising through his infectious excitement about such&nbsp;fundraising.</p>

                    <p>Nathan has done an excellent job in his role as a VISTA here at UTEC! He  took on a leading role in coordinating UTEC&#8217;s most comprehensive and successfull fundraiser to date. He has contributed immensely by helping us organize and develop a new online grants database (which I strongly believe will be a model for other nonprofits on how to best integrate technology into their development work). He has written and won grants.   He has created a well organized foundation/donor recognition system that has substantially improved our capacity for relationship building with funders. And he has provided much excitement around the development of a new individual donor organization process. I have been very pleased with Nathan&#8217;s work (this being his first time in a development position as this) and would rehire him in a&nbsp;minute.</p>

                    <p>Nathan took a leading role in coordinating all aspects of our first major fundraiser. With our Dvelopment Director out sick for some time during this period, he was sometimes running this without a ton of support. He took this as a challenge and semed to be invigorated by the challenge&#8230; never pessimistic or overwhelmed by stress. In the end, we had nearly 200 guests attend and profited nearly $10,000. Moreover, all those who attended coninue today to talk about how professional and well orchestrated it was. Ultimately, Nathan was able to establish the inception of what will now be the annual fundraiser event for UTEC&#8230;.each year building upon the success of all his work this past&nbsp;year.</p>
