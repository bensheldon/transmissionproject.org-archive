                    <p>Goal 1:  Continue to develop volunteer training program for instructors and classroom assistants plus expand volunteer recruitment to include interns, work-study and other community service organizations in order to develop a support mechanism for all essential functions of the EDGE project.  Emphasize recruitment of bilingual volunteers to assist with our increasing number of non-English-speaking&nbsp;participants. </p>
<p>Goal 2:  Insure future availability of basic computer and Internet training plus increase offsite access to EDGE training by helping to create online versions of handouts, interactive tutorials and instructional&nbsp;video. </p>
<p>Goal 3:  Increase local awareness of The EDGE program plus work toward ensuring future<br />
support by researching, identifying or contacting potential community partners, local and national corporations, local and national foundations and other possible grant sources.  Present grant-writing opportunities to the Project Director and assist in the grant writing process and implementation of grant award projects as&nbsp;needed.</p>

                    <p>During Kimberly’s year with the EDGE the attendance number rose to over 3800.  Kim was very successful in building good rapport with the EDGE clients and encouraged increased participation in both instructor-led and self-paced tutorial sessions, especially with our older population and our&nbsp;teens. </p>
<p>Kim worked on a volunteer recruitment plan and helped in the development of a new Volunteer application form.  Volunteer hours increased to an average of 25 hours per month in her last six months, up from just 6 hours per month during her first 6&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2005, The EDGE saw the return of work-study students from one of the local universities.  Kim worked well with these students and guided them in duties to help sustain the EDGE after her term&nbsp;ended.</p>
<p>Kim’s rapport with Hispanic participants helped The EDGE increase its number of Hipanic clients.   As the University of Missouri Extension office announced that they would be discontinuing their bilingual technology workshops at the EDGE in September 2005, the library system began addressing the issue of bilingual volunteers through its newly created Diversity committee. Bilingual library staff are now working on a plan to offer established EDGE courses in Spanish some time in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Over 50 class handouts and two interactive tutorials are now posted on the EDGE website.   Kim assisted EDGE staff in making these handouts available in a variety of&nbsp;formats.</p>
<p>Kim has researched and presented several suggestions for both community and national partnerships and grant opportunities to the project&nbsp;director.</p>
<p>Kim helped obtain the required materials to support the Library’s application for a “Make a Difference” Scholarship grant.  The application focused on The EDGE program.  This grant was awarded by the University of Missouri to the Springfield Greene County Library as the library in Missouri applying the best use of technology to help its&nbsp;community.</p>

                    <p>Kim’s help has made it possible for The EDGE program to continue to serve the members of the community by helping them improve and expand their technology and information seeking skills.  With a decrease in grant funding and the library’s budgetary constraints, the help received from VISTA is essential for the continuation and growth of the EDGE&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>In building the capacity of the Grand Rapids Institute for Information Democracy, Tom took on the following&nbsp;responsibilities:</p>
<p>Media Monitoring – this includes daily logging of local news coverage for the studies that GRIID produces yearly on election coverage, race <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gender representation, and any other issue that we may be monitoring. This may also include occasional monitoring of entertainment media; commercials, movies, ads,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Grant Funded Projects – this includes assisting GRIID on grant funded projects that involve working with students and community groups on issues such as tobacco, gender issues and the West Michigan Progressive Directory. This work gives us an opportunity to apply the resources developed in the media monitoring&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Web Site Maintenance and Design – Tom has learned some of the basics of web design and has helped update and create new content for the GRIID website (<a href="http://www.griid.org" title="www.griid.org">www.griid.org</a>).  In particular, he updated the GRIID media directory and the GRIID lending library pages.  Tom also designed and created his AmeriCorps VISTA web page (<a href="http://www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/" title="www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/">www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/</a>).   </p>
<p>Community Outreach Projects – working on various community-based projects that GRIID is involved in through the Progressive Directory. This involves attending meetings, conducting media trainings, producing media with community groups, and promoting the coalition building through the Progressive Directory. In many ways this is the main outcome goal of GRIID – getting community groups to develop their own media&nbsp;strategies.</p>

            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>Tom played an essential role in completing the Youth Anti-Tobacco Advocacy  Project (<a href="http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/" title="http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/">http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/</a>)  He collected and correlated all the data for this study and created the online report.  He also worked with the student volunteers in creating the study and accompanied them when they presented the study to the Grand Rapids City commission.  Tom also helped in the creation of several grant-funded video productions that GRIID produced, assisting in both the editing and the filming&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Tom does about half of the actual news watching that GRIID undertakes, and is responsible for documenting and tabulating all of the news watching data collected.  He also has taken an active part in writing GRIID studies examining local media coverage on various issues. Over the last six months, Tom played a significant role in creating the content in GRIID’s Election Watch 2004&nbsp;feature.</p>
<p>Tom worked on the grant funded Video Voter Project.  This project tied into GRIID’s election monitoring and education efforts.  Tom’s work monitoring and documenting news coverage were important components of the Video Voter&nbsp;Project.</p>
<p>Tom has been involved in several projects designed to reach out and empower community groups. Tom has been one of the producers of Catalyst Radio, a weekly radio program on the CMC’s radio station WYCE FM.  Catalyst Radio provides news analysis and interviews featuring local community groups and organizations.  Tom writes half of the news analysis pieces as well as being one of the shows on-air voices.  He also is responsible for setting up and conducting the interviews on occasion as well as updating the Catalyst Radio website every&nbsp;week. </p>
<p>Another community outreach effort that Tom has been involved with is GRIID’s work on FCC license renewals procedure education.  This is an effort to build an awareness in the community on the FCC license renewal process which was designed to hold the local TV media accountable to community needs.  As part of this project, Tom has given presentations, created mailing literature, and helped create online&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>GRIID maintains a large collection of documentaries pertaining to issues of media literacy and media and democracy.  Tom has helped organize and promote public showings of these documentary films.  Tom also helped facilitate public discussions following the&nbsp;films.</p>

                    <p>• Only a few computers were recycled to low-income families and individuals because that effort was given a low priority until early&nbsp;2003.</p>
<p>• Adam assisted in the detailed technology assessment of the ARC of the Tri-Cities facility.  This involved assessment of a network of about 20 computers and subsequent repair/upgrades.  He also helped sort and refurbish about 30 donated computers, making them ready for eventual home&nbsp;placement.</p>
<p>• Adam wrote, edited and revised a grant request to Verizon for a portable teaching computer lab.  Verizon responded with $9,000 in funding.  The portable lab (4 laptop computers, network, and SVGA projector)  is now operational. Additionally, the RECA Foundation is now a Verizon e-partner and has started providing technology classes to non-profit agencies in the&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>• Adam wrote, edited and revised a $20,000 “Progressive Technology” grant application to America Connects Consortium.  This project will provide for the development of a standard Linux based computer that can be replicated by other CTCNet members all over the&nbsp;U.S.</p>
<p>• Adam&#8217;s major focus was on completely redesigning the CBPIN.ORG web site (<a href="http://www.cbpin.org/" title="http://www.cbpin.org/">http://www.cbpin.org/</a>).  Most of the development work was completed. The work needs to be finalized and a new CBPIN server put in&nbsp;place.</p>

                    <p>Matt has developed a database of hundreds of potential funding sources for BWM and TechMission.  He has narrowed down that database to a list of the top 20 prospects.  We have used that database and research to provide information on grant opportunities to hundreds of other CTC’s through our E-mail list.  Matthew has developed template grants for both PREP and TechMission that follow the Associated Grantmakers format and other standard formats.  We have made available some of these templates to hundreds of other CTC’s through our E-mail list and on our website to assist them in developing resources and&nbsp;grantwriting.</p>
<p>Matthew has also been working with us in our partnerships with organizations to help provide resources to CTC’s.  Matthew has provided feedback to other CTC’s on their grant applications for free computers to the Beaumont Foundation.  In addition, he has assisted in the review process with the Beaumont Foundation and the Connections for Tomorrow&nbsp;consortium.  </p>
<p>Matt has also been involved in many of the strategy discussions for sustainability for TechMission Inc.  He has assisted us in applying for an AmeriCorps state application and an AmeriCorps national application.  In addition, he has worked with us to secure resources from the Boston Foundation and is assisting us in developing other resources. He has also assisted us in applying for the Department of Education CTC grant, which we were&nbsp;awarded.</p>
<p>We plan to hire Matthew to work for TechMission after completion of his VISTA&nbsp;year.</p>

                    <p>Brenda Jackson began her work as a VISTA volunteer with PLUK in June of 2002. Her principal goal has been to further develop the technology center programs, outreach to other community organizations and sustainability. We’ve come a long way and then some with Brenda’s assistance.  The centerpiece has been funding for a state-wide tutoring program for at-risk children which is headquartered within the technology center. Brenda was a participant in an eight-month program for training collaborative teams around the state to evaluate technology needs for individuals with disabilities. We continue to benefit from her efforts by being awarded a Beaumont Foundation Grant she had written for a mobile lab to be used for&nbsp;training.</p>
