                    <p>SoFAB is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the celebration and preservation of the cultural foodways of the American south. In addition SoFAB embraces issues of literacy, nutrition and health, and spotlighting minority cultures through the lens of&nbsp;food.</p>

                    <p>This project would involve an update of SoFAB&#8217;s website. This would include the integration of the e-commerce site, blog, twitter and Facebook components, the newsletter, developing the e-zine, collections, and the wiki of Southern Food. This would make the marketing of SoFAB more modern and direct. It would mean that we will reach more members of the community who can become involved with SoFAB and its&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>The website touches all aspects of the operations of SoFAB. The work of this project would make the entire operation of SoFAB more modern, more interactive and thus more inclusive of the entire community. It also means that people who cannot come to New Orleans will be able to engage in interaction with the museum, see on-line exhibits, access our collections and be more engaged with the&nbsp;museum.</p>
<p>The VISTA member would be helping SoFAB &#8220;catch up&#8221; and would train the appropriate staff to maintain and continue to update the technical capacity of the organization. In-person training, as well as a training manual, would be a legacy that would build the capacity of the&nbsp;organization.</p>
<p>SoFAB has determined that increased web presence is important by the evaluation of the following evidence: Increased electronic feedback from basic use of Facebook and Twitter, Increased attendance at events from use of social media, The increased interest from the entire southern geographic area when web-based information is disseminated. By taking advantage of technology now, SoFAB will not fall behind in its development and can advance itself in this early time in our development so that we can operate on a par with more established organizations and comply with expectations of&nbsp;visitors.</p>
<p>A technology specialist from VISTA would make it possible for SoFAB to advance itself into the world of technology, be more intergrated, and probably have their own ideas that will also contribute to making SoFAB an organization that better serves its consitutency because it operates more smoothly, can increase its earned income and be more&nbsp;accesible.</p>
<p>In addition the VISTA member would help us build capacity to continue the technological advances, by training the staff and preparing a&nbsp;manual.</p>

                    1. There will be an improved e-commerce site that will garner more internet hits.
2. There will be a viable e-zine which will allow the organization to earn more revenue.
3. The Southern food wiki will allow us to be the &quot;Go to&quot; site for all things related to Southern food.
4. On line exhibits will be developed.
5. The curricula for cooking and nutrition classes and the literacy program will be available on line and may thus be implemented in other locations.
6. A manual which describes the maintenance of the project.        </div>

                <span class="field-content"><p>First, because of her willingness to become a part of the organization, and secondly, because of her knowledge and understanding of the technology, Kelsey became integral to our planning process, helping us to make choices and actually use the advances in technology in new ways. She dragged us into thinking in new ways about what we were doing, so that now our entire culture has changed into being not only more modern, more attuned to technology, but also in now thinking to include new technologies in all of our projects and in our actions. This was a major cultural shift, accomplished by the example and encouragement of our VISTA&nbsp;member.</p>
<p>1. An update of SoFAB’s website, including the integration of the e-commerce site and blog. This goal was completely accomplished, except that we have merely archived the old blog and have begun to use our Facebook account instead.<br />
2. Twitter and Facebook components were established.<br />
3. The newsletter, developing the e-zine, collections, and the wiki of Southern Food have all been advanced.<br />
4. Our website was entirely redesigned and completely updated and reorganized. Our VISTA member was the primary person behind all of this, assisted by summer interns and other&nbsp;volunteers.</p>

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
