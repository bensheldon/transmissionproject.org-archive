                    <p>Mike has updated CTOC’s current database and is 70% complete with updating the information on CTOC members of organizations. Our VISTA has gained considerable knowledge of the organizations listed in our membership database and will be able to easily consolidate both databases into one main database. With the consolidation of both databases that total over six hundred (600) CTC’s, CTOC will be able to significantly improve our outreach&nbsp;efforts. </p>
<p>As part of the updating procedures we have contacted each organization to establish a contact person for each non-profit organization that provides technology services. Mike has completed updating 70% of the organizations’ contact information and has been able to find a designated person for each organization and updating their email addresses. His efforts to gain the correct contact information for these organizations  has provided CTOC with a face and voice in the community and increased our visibility with CTCs in Los Angeles. With the increased visibility in the CTC community we have been able to increase the attendance of CTOC members and Non-Member to event workshops by at least&nbsp;30%.</p>
<p>Mike has designed and developed promotional materials for at least three of CTOC’s events over the past three&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Mike reviewed materials on evaluation methods and was instrumental in assisting CTOC’s staff in the development of a survey instrument that we are using to collect data on the CTCs in the Los Angeles region. Mike completed 24 CTC site visits in Los Angeles. Not only have these site visits given us a chance to collect information on the local CTC, it has given him an opportunity to get first hand knowledge of the types of programs that are offered by the various CTCs around Los Angeles. We have collected data on 61 CTCs in the Los Angeles region including San Bernardino County. Over the past six (6) months he has enter the 60% of the data that will be used of evaluation. Over the next six (6) months he will assist the staff with data&nbsp;evaluation. </p>
<p>Mike has provided us with information on funding resources that are available via the CTCnet listserv. He has participated and given input in our discussions on being a CTCnet chapter affiliate. He will be doing some research and grant writing for demonstration project that we will&nbsp;undertake.</p>

                    <p>Ria has done a good job of connecting with schools and organizations to<br />
create alliances for projects and for recruitment. Ria hasalso  been wonderfully effective at recruiting guest speakers and field trip hosts for&nbsp;GGD.</p>
<p>Ria has done a wonderful job of preparing program information for the public, including the fall GGD update (sent to funders and partner agencies) and the December graduation flier. Because the program’s outreach has been so successful, there has not been a need for the extensive outreach we have had in the&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>I believe Ria’s work on program curriculum and her work in the classroom will be one of her greatest legacies in the program. She has developed strong curricula and has led successful, creative classes. She has developed curriculum for and taught the fall and spring classes and has developed a proposal for a summer video program. Her teaching style with the students has been steadily improving, and her comfort level and ability in working with students in and out of the classroom has been a pleasure to watch&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p>Michael has developed training materials for youth in New Horizons and is also teaching classes.

Because we cancelled our summer camp this year, Michael was not able to develop any curriculum for the&nbsp;camp.</p>

                    <p>With respect to the VISTA project, it is Breakaway Technologies goal to assist individuals with 6th grade reading and math skills to increase their skills to ninth grade levels via our contextualized literacy program.  To that end, we have developed a first draft of a scenario-based curriculum in collaboration with Carnegie Melon University, Bay ITC, and Cabrillo&nbsp;College.</p>
<p>Tabetha assisted in developing and is now working out the final bugs in the curriculum for our contextualized literacy program. She has submitted the curriculum to the American Association of Community Colleges and is currently awaiting&nbsp;feedback.</p>
<p>Tabetha has also assisted in developing partnerships with institutions in the surrounding&nbsp;area.</p>

                    <p>Margaret has been progressing remarkably well in her VISTA year. She has progressing well in developing a system of technical support for our computer center.  Margaret has developed a system where most of our computers are using the same drive image.  This allows us to re-image computers in just a few minutes if any problems occur.  Margaret has also been repairing computers donated to our computer center and has distributed 50 computers to individuals and organizations through an earn-a-computer&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Margaret has developed a system where most of our computers are using the same drive image.  This allows us to re-image computers in just a few minutes if any problems occur.  Margaret has also been repairing computers donated to our computer center and should be distributing between 50-100 computers to individuals and&nbsp;organizations.  </p>
<p>Margaret has also developed curriculum for our A+ certification class and tested it with over 15 students last semester.  About 5 of her students have returned this semester to volunteer to teach classes.  Margaret has also developed curriculum for our Microsoft Certified System Engineer courses.  Last semester she developed curriculum for our Windows 2000 Server course, and this semester she developed curriculum for our Windows 2000 Networking course, with about 30 students in total between the two&nbsp;courses.</p>
<p>There have been no major difficulties for Margaret in her VISTA year.  After completing her year, we have decided to hire Margaret as&nbsp;staff.</p>

                    <p>Scott came to BNN in September 2002.  He quickly became a valuable member of the BNN team, assisting with Ed/Out projects that promote BNN services, teaching video production, assisting members with non-linear editing, troubleshooting edit equipment, and producing public service announcements.  Scott has raised the production standards of BNN with his excellent editing and shooting skills.  He has also assisted with print promotions such as newsletters and&nbsp;flyers.</p>
<p>Due to Scott’s excellent production capabilities he was able to complete a number of PSAs, instructional videos, and community based programs for BNN.  Such programs included the 10 part series &#8220;Sister Talk 2,&#8221; a program aimed at African American women to raise awareness of cardiovascular health.  Scott assisted Barbara Barrow-Murray, BNN’s Roxbury Studio Manager, with editing the series.  Scott also played a large role in helping to modernize the look of the channel, creating promotional spots, and helping to improve the channel’s&nbsp;graphics.</p>
