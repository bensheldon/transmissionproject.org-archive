 <title>More on learning from mistakes</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/2/more-on-learning-from-mistakes</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;No one is immune to making mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;
And I have to express admiration to those who will admit it, learn from it, and make the changes necessary to respond to it.&lt;br /&gt;
But to make mistakes and changes at such a high level and talk about it, well, that&amp;#8217;s like superhero stuff to me.&lt;br /&gt;
Take this week&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/14/AR2010021403550.html&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; from the White&amp;nbsp;House:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
White House officials are retooling the administration&amp;#8217;s communications strategy to produce faster responses to political adversaries, a more disciplined focus on President Obama&amp;#8217;s call for &amp;#8220;change&amp;#8221; in Washington and an increasingly selective use of the president&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messaging adjustments are the result of an end-of-the-year analysis in which White House advisers said the president&amp;#8217;s communications team had not taken the initiative often enough and had allowed drawn-out debates in Congress, and relentless criticism by Republicans, to drown out his&amp;nbsp;message.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it&amp;#8217;s a political move.  But what do any of us do for our organizations that isn&amp;#8217;t, in essence, a political move to build support and resources for us to do our work better?  We constantly hone our messages, revise our plans, and change our methods.&lt;br /&gt;
If we keep our eye on the long view, know why we do what we do, and admit why we&amp;#8217;re doing it, we can build movements built on trust and openness.&lt;br /&gt;
Administration, I say to you: Keep on&amp;nbsp;learning. &lt;/p&gt;
