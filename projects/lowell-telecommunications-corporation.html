                <span class="field-content"><p>Peter oversaw and directly implemented numerous aspects of the &#8220;DigitalBicycle&#8221; project, primarily focusing on developing a Drupal-based centralized web community that leverages the power of the distributed network but provides for efficient and usable group collaboration. This included planning the framework and workflow of the site, the setup and administration of the server, development and implementation of the code that powers the system, and preparation for the future expansion of the project as it moves from a beta project to having a working user base. In addition to developing the core web system, Peter worked with outside volunteers to develop the specification for a desktop publishing application called “Sprocket” and managed its development by outside programmers. Furthermore, Peter has spec’d out and begun development on a Linux-based client-side system, “KickStand”, which handles the automatic seeding and downloading of specified material and is designed to be used by participating&nbsp;organizations.</p>

        Quote:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>The fact of the matter is that the CTC VISTA program is directly responsible for where we are today with this project, ready to build capacity for organizations around the country. To get to this point we needed the full-time attention of a highly skilled programmer interested in working in a community-service setting. Not only would we have not been able to recruit someone at this level for this position without the CTC VISTA program, but in our current, pre-income generating phase we never would have been able to hire them. I have long felt that one of the primary strengths of the CTC VISTA program is how it empowers both the organization and the individual volunteer. The individual gains the opportunity to engage full-time on a project that is primed for growth but for which they might never be hired in a normal full-time capacity. The organization gains the opportunity to devote energies that might not otherwise be budgetable and if successful, build its own capacity to a point that it is able to hire an individual to continue the work started under the VISTA project. We are happy to report that this is exactly what happened at LTC.<br />
	Though we had high expectations when we were developing our work plan last year and recruiting a VISTA to accomplish it, Peter exceeded our expectations in every regard. While some of this was due to his accomplished background and well-developed skill set, it is mainly due to the fact that Peter worked extraordinarily hard and was as committed to this project as anyone could possibly be. Peter took the idea of 24-hour service quite seriously, working long hours at LTC and often late nights at home. Though frequently traveling on behalf of LTC he has established systems allowing him to continue development anywhere with a network connection. Beyond that, he’s been known to write code by hand on a legal pad when other options are not available. Peter has proven himself as an excellent VISTA and we anticipate that he will do the same as a VISTA supervisor this next year. We are extremely appreciative of Peter’s hard work and of the CTC VISTA project for providing us with the opportunity to grow our capacity so greatly in the past year. The CTC VISTA project is truly our most valuable partner in the DigitalBicycle collaboration and we will work to recognize it as such online and in&nbsp;person.</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>I&#8217;ve run two more sessions of the &#8220;Intro to Web Forms&#8221; curriculum, which has been a success with the LCTC community. The only barrier to our success has been the lack of publicity in the course, which we are hoping to improve in future runnings.  The advantage of having a set, web based curriculum is that another member can pick up this course and teach it without having to recreate the course from&nbsp;scratch. </p>
<p>After starting work on the UTEC project in the second quarter, our first web database application rolled out on April 16, 2003.  This was a great opportunity to work with a Non profit that help us iron out our software development process and be enthusiastic with our end product. Since then we have made several major changes, including recreating the user interface to a more malleable design and  adding functionality as the user&nbsp;requests. </p>
<p>Fellow Vista David Siegal and I have been working on this project as a team&nbsp;effort. </p>
<p>Recently I have been working on system administration tasks. One example is making our lab more available to volunteers, by ensuring that all workstations have the proper software.  Once finished, our website designers can come in whenever they need to and use the latest software that we can provide&nbsp;them.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>One of the most successful procedures that I implemented was to have all members and staff wear picture ID&#8217;s while in the facility.  Since I had a little knowledge of digital photography it was easy for me to make the adjustments in our new&nbsp;database.</p>
<p>The second success story for me was to learn Facil database for non-profits and help teach the rest of the staff the functions of the database.This program is really  great for the members because they now can reserve things in an orderly fashion and they get the feeling of being a greater part of the whole process.  The community as a whole benefits from the installation of&nbsp;Facil.</p>
<p>My other accomplishments include mail server.  I learned how to maintain the accounts on the e-mail server service and recently on our new list-server.  I am now certified in Field Production.  Who would have&nbsp;guessed.</p>
<p>I have managed to put up a web site, sparse as it may be, and to shoot and edit a thirty minute video for airing.  The web site sort of took a back seat when I became involved in running a camera on a television show.  My interest really peaked when staff members told me that I could do a show of my own.  The patience and help of my co-workers enabled me to increase my knowledgeable in non linear editing. And with practice I am sure I’ll become&nbsp;proficient.</p>

Kevin has been leading the project to transfer our network from a Windows to a Linux operating system, while training two staff members to be able to take on the technical duties when he&nbsp;leaves.</p>
<p>With regard to goal 2, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Lowell site is essentially complete, although has not been launched due to decisions still to be made on the part of the club. Unfortunately, we fell short on this goal, which was to complete three sites by the end of Kevin’s term. .  We hope to have Kevin create a template that can be used by other nonprofits that would like a&nbsp;website. </p>
<p>As a result of Kevin’s work on goal 3, we have a rough draft of the first part of a project based Excel training near completion, and hope to have the beta version done by Kevin&#8217;s&nbsp;departure. </p>
<p>We had two other goals Kevin was going to work on that we did not pursue. One was helping with the development of an information-interviewing library; the other was working on developing a volunteer program for the Lowell Community Technology&nbsp;Consortium.</p>

• email w/ virus checking<br />
• databases<br />
• SSL<br />
• automatic creation of test systems<br />
• programmatic manipulation of&nbsp;images</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done this additional work outside our charter:<br />
• Trained 40 people in basic UNIX<br />
• Kept the Mercier public access center open and staffed.<br />
• Some other dinky stuff like cleaning up&nbsp;lowellhabitat.org</p>
<p>The SUEXEC project pretty well sums up our experience. It is essential for the future, yet not very incomprehensible to management and time consuming. Further, the available person to lead the project was smart and hardworking but completely&nbsp;inexperienced</p>
<p>Dan spent most of his Fridays and many Saturday&#8217;s this year working with a volunteer to get this project finished. It would have been quicker to do the work himself, but the volunteer benefited greatly from the experience and is eager to contribute more next&nbsp;summer.</p>

We do not expect that every VISTA will have all the necessary skills to accomplish these, but we would like to see the bringing together of a team of individuals that can support and build upon their individual&nbsp;strengths.</p>

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
