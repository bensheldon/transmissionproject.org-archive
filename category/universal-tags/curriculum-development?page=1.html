                    <p>Our goal is to move SCAT into the digital age without leaving behind anyone in the Somerville communities SCAT has been serving for over 25 years: at-risk youth, immigrant communities, low- and middle-income people and organizations who feel ignored by the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media, and seniors looking for a way to make their voices and concerns&nbsp;heard.</p>
<p>VISTA responsibilities&nbsp;include</p>
<p>Planning and policy work:<br />
Research how other public access stations have &#8220;crossed the digital divide&#8221; and implemented computer center programs, as well as programs related to the new digital video technologies, make recommendations to SCAT staff and Board of Directors, and help implement the plan, which would include the purchase of some&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p>Outreach:<br />
Collaboration on the development of messages and programming for the public access channel aimed at making people aware of the new resources and programs at SCAT; development of printed outreach material; personal outreach work, such as visiting service agencies, youth groups, community associations, etc., with a translator when&nbsp;necessary</p>
<p>Training Program:<br />
Design and implementation of a creative program of training on the computer stations, especially related to the Internet and to the multimedia possibilities offered by the world wide web; collaboration with SCAT staff who work with the non-linear editing system in the design and implementation of new multimedia training courses; design and implementation of an advanced training program related to web site design, video streaming,&nbsp;etc.</p>

                    <p>The VISTA member will perform a variety of tasks related to program&nbsp;development. </p>
<p>First, the VISTA member will be responsible for student recruitment. This will include creating recruitment materials and a strategy that will encourage more students to join our program. Possible duties will include developing relationships with area schools and public housing communities in the search for students, and organizing student recruitment events both at our computer lab and&nbsp;off-site. </p>
<p>Second, the VISTA member will assist in the development and launching a new program, Grad Central, within Computers4Kids. Distinct from the nine-month Technology Gateways program, Grad Central will be dedicated to Technology Gateways graduates, who tend to be older, are at a higher computer skill level, and have different needs as they prepare for college and careers than Gateways students. The VISTA member will research and develop project ideas for Grad Central, create curriculum for daily activities and ongoing projects, and identify and recruit community members who will be instrumental in achieving the goals of the program (e.g. SAT-prep teachers, career counselors, job shadowing partners,&nbsp;etc.). </p>
<p>Third, we would like our new VISTA to pick up where our previous member left off in regards to student workshops. A major responsibility of our previous VISTA member was to develop workshops for our students on a variety of technology topics. We now have an extensive library of workshop curricula, yet no one to lead the workshops. We would like our VISTA member to recruit enough volunteer workshop leaders to hold several student workshops a&nbsp;month.</p>

                    <p>With regard to student recruitment, Davina developed a brochure and created a calendar/plan for student recruitment. The plan identifies events where we might canvas for students, identifies contacts, who attends, and whether the event was a useful recruitment event. In addition, it includes action steps for non-event related recruitment opportunities. Davina also added recruitment contacts to our database and created materials for the student recruitment display&nbsp;board.</p>
<p>The Grad Cenetral program did not get started until mid April so we did not ask Davina to work on&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Davina scheduled 29 student and mentor workshops (more than our goal) and identified volunteers to lead all workshops. This is a tremendous help to staff as they do not have time to lead the workshops and in prior years we were able to offer fewer workshops because of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Davina became our tech wizard. She maintained the computers in the learning labs. She also did a lot of work on our website, including creating PHP forms which allowed us to create forms that aid in our ability to collect data for evaluating purposes. She also created applications that made it easy for volunteers to sign up to volunteer and report tech&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>Other forms allow us to see what our students have done in the lab each day &#8211; something that has been missing from our program &#8211; and will be helpful in planning and securing future funding. Davina also taught herself captcha which added security to our web based forms. Davina mostly worked independently on these tasks but sought staff input when necessary. She worked most closely with Dolly Joseph, our Program&nbsp;Director.</p>

The systems she put in place will be used by staff for years to come.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>The Coalition for Asian Pacific American Youth is a project of the Asian American Studies Program at University of Massachusetts Boston.  It builds the leadership of Asian American high school students in the greater Boston area through the development and implementation of youth-led projects.  We believe that youth united by a common cause can make a&nbsp;difference.</p>
<p>The following are the types of activities that the AmeriCorps VISTA member will&nbsp;accomplish:</p>
<p>1. Program and Curriculum Planning and Implementation&#8211; The No. One priority of the school in the coming year is to upgrade and update the school’s curriculum. Under the leadership and guidance of the Programs <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Curriculum Committee (PCC) members, the VISTA volunteer will be an active participant in the planning process and will help implement recommendations made by the PCC through out the&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>2. Systematize School Operations and Procedures&#8211; A critical task is to create a reference source for the school’s operations and procedures. The VISTA volunteer will lead the development and production of a set of school handbooks. There will be a general school handbook, a handbook customized for the needs of the teachers and one customized for the students. The development and production of the bi-lingual English/Chinese handbooks will be a collaborative effort with the participation of the school Board and&nbsp;staff.</p>
<p>3. Create/Update Bi-lingual Schools Forms and Pamphlets&#8211; Working with the staff and the Programs <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Curriculum Committee, the VISTA volunteer will be the project leader in updating or creating program description pamphlets; tuition and tuition assistance, and enrollment forms. The staff will assisted in getting all communications materials translated into Chinese. As part of the need to systematize the school operations, the VISTA volunteer will assist in the creation of a student database to capture student profile, track attendance, tuition payment history, et&nbsp;al.</p>
<p>4. Update and Upgrade the School&#8217;s Bilingual Website&#8211; In collaboration with the website volunteer and using information gathered under Items 2 and 3, the VISTA volunteer will lead in the upgrading, updating, and monitoring of the school&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>5. Create a Template to Start a Parent Teacher Association&#8211; In collaboration with the Board and staff and using standard PTA guidelines, the VISTA volunteer will develop the mission/vision and sustainable, start-up goals and programs for a PTA. Once the PTA handbook is approved by the Board, the VISTA volunteer will assist in the start-up phase of the&nbsp;PTA.</p>

                    <p>n the beginning, Katrina centered on constructing infrastructure in KKCS&#8217;s practices and procedures. She has worked with the Head of School to develop institutional policies and procedures, and worked diligently to implement effective and efficient practices in the After School Program. Through recruiting and training volunteers, she has expanded the number of people working with students, thus lessening the student to teacher radio. She has worked to build an efficient Healthy Snack Program which provides the After School students with nutritious and balanced snacks every day. Katrina also has her sights set on the long term impacts that technology can make on KKCS and has been a part of the planning process for our student and school database. Through these and many more tasks, her comprehensive understanding of both the day to day operation as well as the long term goals have helped to bring KKCS to a higher&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>For the first time, Math/English is offered in the After-School program. Katrina designed the curriculum which follows the Boston Public School standards, recruited student teachers from colleges and Boston Latin School to teach these subjects two days a week for two hours each day. Katrina has also provided additional resources such as lesson planning templates, sample lesson plans and best practices. The Math/English program continues to be offered in the After-School&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Though Katrina drafted several of the school handbooks, none were adopted. In an effort to gain input and feedback, it was hoped that separate constituient committees conisisting of teachers, parents and students would be formed. This was not done. Time and resources were the challenge. KKCS&#8217;s website updating was not addressed by the school administration. The Parent Teacher Association had several starts, but did not get organized. This is a brand new concept to KKCS; the appropriate leadership needs to be&nbsp;identified.</p>

                    <p>In response to our rapid membership growth, we saw a rise in the demand for new products and services and realized the need for support tools for our other 3 existing services as well as the importance of support for new services as they are added. Our VISTA will build support resources and strengthen capacity of sub domain web&nbsp;content. </p>
<p>-Build comprehensive online training and support resources for remaining 3 applications in Toolbox and new applications as they are added to the Toolbox. Ensure that applications are fully sustainable <span class="amp">&amp;</span> documented, saving staff time while helping smaller nonprofits make use of the&nbsp;Toolbox.</p>
<p>- Strengthen the capacity of Grassroots.org’s sub domain website content to serve nonprofits, recruit new members, and generate needed attention from nonprofits, volunteers, donors and&nbsp;partners.</p>
<p>-Manage Grassroots.org&#8217;s newsletters, recruit members/partners to publish entries for Grassroots.org&nbsp;blog</p>

                    <p>Scott created help guides, Webinars and supplemental materials to make the Grassroots.org Toolbox experience seamless for al Grassroots.org members. Scott took over the management of our NING social networking site in addition to streamlining our SEO consulting program and making the application process for the Social Venture Consulting program more efficient. Scott authored an extensive amount of content on our blog, such as the &#8220;Tool of the Week&#8221; series and our &#8220;Faces of Change&#8221; video series. In addition, Scott created estore.grassroots.org (a promotional products website resulting in 4% donations for Grassroots.org) and was an essential force in creating Interns.org on Wordpress. Scott&#8217;s positive, can-do attitude enabled him to complete every project he was asked to&nbsp;complete.</p>
<p>Scott ended up developing our NING Community Networking site. Scott fully took over this project from the design to the moderation of the site. Scott also took on the role of reaching out face-to-face with our local members, something he had a personal interest in and showed initiative in doing. In addition to promoting Grassroots.org through attending &#8220;GrassrootsCamp&#8221; NY Tech Meetup events, Scott got involved in the projects of our member orgs. For example, Scott volunteered his time to sketch/design a handbook for Grassroots.org member &#8220;Getting Tools to City Schools&#8221; and their sustainable binder project. Scott is a true joy to have in the office and his greatest accomplishment in my opinion is his positive contribution to&nbsp;morale.</p>

                    <p>Scott was able to accomplish every task that we gave him. Scott was very responsible about asking for help when he needed it and seeking out the tools he needed to complete tasks. It was a pleasure working with him throughout the year and in fact, we hired him at the end of his VISTA&nbsp;term.</p>

                    <p>As the Digital Presenting Coordinator, our VISTA member will work with the Media Archive and Web Team to improve the Appalshop&#8217;s capacity to digitally present its history, work, and issue-based campaigns to diverse internet audiences.  Presentations will consist of text, visuals, audio, and video files.  Specific tasks&nbsp;include:</p>
<p>- Devising a method and/or template for creating web-based digital media<br />
  presentations<br />
- Training Appalshop staff, community members, and youth to make digital<br />
  presentations of their own work<br />
- Developing a plan and infrastructure for uploading presentations to web and<br />
  distributing presentations to multiple,diverse audiences; plan/infrastructure<br />
  should emphasize use of new networking/technology tools like YouTube and MySpace<br />
- Creating an introductory webpage for Appalshop’s Film Division that includes<br />
  articles, interviews, and audio and video pieces about Appalshop Films’ history<br />
  and current work<br />
- Using work from Appalshop&#8217;s Media Archive to create issue- or topic-specific web<br />
  presentations and distributing them to key, yet diverse, web&nbsp;audiences</p>
<p>All web presentations will support Appalshop’s mission to involve the people of Appalachia in the representation of their culture, traditions, and&nbsp;stories.</p>

                    <p>Stewart Machlyn Blair was successful in integrating web 2.0 strategies into Appalshop&#8217;s training programs and building advanced technology learning opportunities for advanced youth so they could continue to contribute to Appalshop&#8217;s overall work as a non-profit media arts and education center. Blair also was successful in initiating and testing digital delivery services, contributing to building the databases necessary to implement digital&nbsp;delivery.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties Blair faced was organizing his time among different responsibilities. This challenge was recognized early in his service and we developed more pro-active mentorship that seemed to&nbsp;help.</p>
