                    <p>Amplifyme is a nonprofit organization that engages people in positive change through the use of media arts. We use pop culture to inspire people to think differently about their power to create change in their lives and the lives of others through civic&nbsp;engagement.</p>
<p>Amplifyme programs provide opportunities for engagement in positive change through the media arts. Our programs focus in four key areas—Media, Music, Video and the Electronic Community. More and more, these methods of communication influence people, both young and old. Unfortunately, not all of these messages are positive. amplifyme’s programs empower participants to create positive messages to reach a broad audience to foster civic&nbsp;engagement.</p>
<p>These programs begin with youth involvement, but are also appropriate for individuals further along in their professional development and who want to participate as a vehicle for change in the&nbsp;media.</p>
<p>- youth media institute Empowers young people with the tools and resources to become future leaders in the media&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>- empowerment music program Works with musicians to produce socially empowering commercially viable music&nbsp;messages.</p>
<p>- movement pictures video program Works with video artists to create and amplify socially responsible video messages in film and&nbsp;television.</p>
<p>- electronic community media program Serves as an online hub for all of amplifyme&#8217;s signature programs, as well as an interactive site for socially responsible music, video, and online community&nbsp;building.</p>

                    <p>Intermedia Arts is Minnesota&#8217;s premier multidisciplinary, multicultural organization. Our mission is to by a catalyst that builds understanding among people through&nbsp;art. </p>
<p>PCTV empowers young people to engage with their communities through learning, teaching and making media. For 15 year, PCTV has taught thousands of Minneapolis teens how to make their own TV shows, video diaries, photo essays, webpages and other media&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>The PCTV crew creates a bi-weekly talk show called Our Turn, a online gallery featuring web design, photography and, creative writing called Mixed Visions, video essays, and other media products. These creative projects reflect public concerns and document work by youth in their neighborhoods. Participants of PCTV, and the schools they are selected from, demonstrate a strong commitment to community service and to engaging young people outside the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
<p>Through their involvement with PCTV, participants develop skills in media literacy, video production and design, including techniques in camera operation, sound, lighting, and editing. They also gain abilities in photography and web design and layout. Simultaneously, students begin strengthening community ties and educating others on important issues. By practicing what it means to be part of a media crew and how to fit in roles such as a director, producer, host, editor, and other operations youth find themselves filled with knowledge and skills enhancing their futures in media&nbsp;production.</p>

<p>We believe a diverse, ethical, and independent media is an essential element of social change and we believe that historically excluded communities must be protagonists in media democracy. Our work combines media creation, media policy education and media organizing to preserve and expand the free press so central to America&#8217;s identity and&nbsp;democracy.</p>
<p>PPH is run and staffed by journalists and community organizers from historically excluded communities. Our projects are unique as we bring together two of the best American traditions: community organizing and independent media creation, to build a community of media organizers: media literate youth and workers who can create and demand a media that functions in their&nbsp;interests.</p>

                    <p>The Neighborhoods Partnership Network (NPN) is a nonprofit, 501c3 organization consisting of a citywide network of neighborhoods that was established after the Hurricane Katrina disaster to facilitate neighborhood collaboration, increase access to government and information, and strengthen the voices of individuals and communities across New&nbsp;Orleans.</p>
<p>The disasters revealed significant weakness in many structures Americans took for granted – physical structures such levees <span class="amp">&amp;</span> hospitals, but also governing and social structures from FEMA to state and local entities. Citizens have had to become their own “first responders” – from rescuing their neighbors to rescuing their neighborhoods. NPN is one such organization born from both the failures and opportunities the catastrophe has&nbsp;provided.</p>
<p>NPN realized that a need existed for a citywide framework to assist communities in maximizing the use of limited resources and information while providing connections to other communities that have similar obstacles so that communities can avoid duplicating efforts and work toward shared goals. The infrastructure of this organization answers New Orleanians’ desires to be involved in the formal decision-making processes that impact quality of life issues for citizens and&nbsp;neighborhoods.</p>
<p>NPN’s mission is to improve the quality of life by engaging New Orleanians in neighborhood revitalization and civic processes. NPN consists of a board of community leaders reflective of neighborhoods throughout the city and a diverse staff immersed in coalition building, public and government relations. NPN envisions a New Orleans where all neighborhoods are great places to&nbsp;live.</p>

                    <p>The National Black Programming Consortium (NBPC) is dedicated to developing black digital authorship, and distributing unique stories of the black experience in the new media age through enlightening digital content and community&nbsp;engagement.</p>
<p>NBPC is a national nonprofit with a 30-year track record of increasing capacity in minority communities by funding programming about the Black experience and issues for public television; mentoring emerging producers; and providing professional development training opportunities. With the emergence of the Internet as a viable method of broadcast and distribution, NBPC created the New Media Institute (NMI) in 2006 to train a new generation of makers to produce content across digital platforms. Two major initiatives grew out of NMI collaborations &#8211; MojoCo.org, a citizen journalism web portal and training program, and the Public Media Corps, a national service supporting creative, sustainable and community-initiated methods for addressing the broadband divide in communities of color. Both projects extend NBPC’s impact beyond broadcasters to a new generation of community-based media makers, concerned with creating relevant content that will impact the well being of their&nbsp;communities.</p>
