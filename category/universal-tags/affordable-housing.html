                    <p>Within the past year, the Tenants Organization, with central help from an AmeriCorps*VISTA Member, has developed an extraordinarily high-density, publicly accessible wireless mesh network that covers most of Castle Square Apartments and provides free Internet access to residents. It has also developed a computer repair and refurbishing system that provides services to&nbsp;residents. </p>
<p>Starting in August 2007, a new VISTA Member will play a central coordinating role&nbsp;in:</p>
<p>* Enhancing assessment systems to monitor and analyze the capacity of the community wireless network at Castle Square to provide needed service to&nbsp;residents</p>
<p>* Develop practices and procedures to improve the network&nbsp;capacity</p>
<p>* Further develop a technical assistance system to enhance Castle Square residents&#8217; home computer use, including use of work/study students from the nearby Benjamin Frankin Institute of Technology and youth peer leaders who are Castle Square&nbsp;residents</p>
<p>* Design and initiate a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher program at Castle Square Apartments, including outreach to potential donors of equipment, and assembling and coordinating a team of work-study students, youth residents and volunteers to implement the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>* Expand community partnerships with other Boston area housing developments interested in establishing free WiFi networks for residents and provide technical assistance to the work at these other&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>* Attempt to secure additional financial and other resources to provide ongoing support to Castle Square Tenants Organization and other Boston area CDCs and tenants&#8217; organizations seeking to establish WiFi&nbsp;networks</p>
<p>* Develop and offer multilingual, largely locally-produced, content on a LAN&nbsp;server</p>

                    <p>Gabriel had a very successful year of service with our organization and we are very happy with the work he has done. He was responsible for a number of improvements at our&nbsp;center.</p>
<p>1. Gabriel established a relationship with RCN and was able to arrange a deal to change all of our organizations phone and internet service, including our wireless backhaul, to RCN, saving us more than $1000 each year, and more than doubling our&nbsp;bandwith.</p>
<p>2. Gabriel developed a plan to have our organization host three technology events, titled Boston Tech Days, where low income residents would be given the opportunity to interact with technology professionals in Boston to receive computer repair services and computer trainings. Gabe wrote a short proposal to help us fund these Tech Days. This proposal won us over $1500 for each Tech Day (approximately $5000 total) to help us pay for equipment, staff, and other&nbsp;expenses.</p>
<p>3. Gabe assisted us in establishing a new location for our Computer Repair Clinic that offers free technical support to all Castle Square residents. With his help, we were able to respond to over 250 requests for technical support from residents during his year here. The Computer Repair Clinic also offers refurbished PCs to residents in need, and under Gabe&#8217;s management, we have already donated approximately 100 computers this year. Before he left, he initiated a plan to move the Repair Clinic to the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, which will significantly increase our capacity and ability to serve residents of the entire South&nbsp;End.</p>
<p>4. Before Gabe left, he helped us to write a proposal that won us $5000 from Social Justice Works! an organization in Cambridge that funds programs by Cambridge Public School graduates. This money will enable us to start a Youth Council that will be entrusted with redesigning our playground over the next few&nbsp;months.</p>

This is a huge help to us and will impact us for many years going forward. Over 100 families now have working computers and improved internet service, and some of them are enrolling in technology programs in our center, or in other centers in the area to improve their skills.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>The Low Income Housing Institute develops, owns and operates housing for the benefit of low-income, homeless and formerly homeless people in Washington State; advocates for just housing policies at the local and national levels; and administers a range of supportive service programs to assist those we serve in maintaining stable housing and increasing their&nbsp;self-sufficiency.  </p>
<p>Founded in 1991, LIHI has grown to be one of the most productive affordable housing developers in the Northwest. LIHI owns and/or manages over 1,700 housing units at 50 sites in six counties throughout the Puget Sound region. Eighty percent of LIHI housing is reserved for households earning less than 30 percent of the area median household&nbsp;income.</p>
<p>LIHI provides a variety of supportive services to help residents maintain their housing and develop self-sufficiency. Our efforts include providing residents with case management, life skills training, technology access and training, financial literacy training and savings programs, and activities for some of the more than 500 children in LIHI&nbsp;housing.</p>
<p>LIHI also owns and operates the Urban Rest Stop, a much-needed hygiene facility for homeless individuals and families located in downtown Seattle, serves approximately 5,000 unduplicated individuals each year. The URS is designed to serve a wide range of people including homeless adults, families with children, youth and the elderly. Urban Rest Stop patrons include disabled persons, veterans, non-English-speaking individuals and people of&nbsp;color.</p>
<p>LIHI believes that affordable housing does not mean poor quality housing. We believe that innovative partnerships, creative project development and sustainable design features in affordable housing makes for a healthy, strong, and committed&nbsp;community.</p>

                    <p>Founded in 1966, Madison Park Development Corporation is one of the nation&#8217;s first community-based, non-profit organizations to independently develop affordable housing for low and moderate income residents. MPDC created a model of resident-led community development, and has evolved to become a comprehensive agency promoting the full revitalization and redevelopment of Roxbury. With resident leadership, MPDC has undertaken numerous programs to address the social and economic needs of the community and has endeavored to link all of its efforts into a sustainable, holistic approach to revitalizing our target&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>Despite the successes we have achieved over the last four decades, the work of revitalizing Roxbury is not complete. MPDC strongly believes in community partnerships because we want to build, and be members of, a strong and healthy community. We embrace partnerships that strengthen each other&#8217;s organizations and institutions. We know through collaboration we can build power and harness our collective capacity to advocate for&nbsp;change.</p>

The center promotes local technology awareness and education by providing low-income area youth and adults with the opportunity to enhance their computer skills. The Center offers technology training and provides hardware and software to various sites throughout the Lee County area. Currently 560 individuals (children and adults) have taken advantage of the Technology center and the programs offered. Lee County CDC also provides space for the Lee County GED/ABE Adult Education Program in cooperation with Crowley’s Ridge Vo-Tech Center in Forrest City. The average enrollment for this class both day and night is 15&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>Lee County CDC served as the pilot site for the Biz Tech Program. The Biz Tech program is an on-line entrepreneurial development program which focuses on teaching youth the skills needed to start their own businesses. Fifteen youth participated in this pilot project; with eight of those young people working together to start a small business called “A Little Something Special”. The group made, marketed and sole individualized gift baskets for Valentine’s Day. The business project was successful and ended showing a&nbsp;profit.</p>

                    <p>Fenway CDC is a membership organization that works to achieve greater residential stability and diversity in the Fenway neighborhood. We engage residents in community planning, develop affordable housing, and advocate for community services primarily aimed at meeting the needs of low- and moderate-income residents. We envision the Fenway as an urban village - a model of smart growth and sustainability where both residential and institutional neighbors thrive. Toward this end, we seek to capitalize on the opportunities and address the challenges arising from the Fenway&#8217;s unique concentration of world-renowned institutions, which are important drivers of the regional&nbsp;economy.</p>
