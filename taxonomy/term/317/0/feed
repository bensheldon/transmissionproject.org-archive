 <title>Gov 2.0 Summit</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/09/gov-20-summit</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gov 2.0 Summit brings together innovators from government and the private sector to highlight technology and ideas that can be applied to the nation’s great challenges. In areas as diverse as education, health care, energy, jobs, and financial reform, there are unique opportunities to rethink how government agencies perform their mission and serve our citizens. Social media, cloud computing, web, and mobile technologies—all provide new capabilities that government agencies are beginning to harness to achieve demonstrably better results at lower&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happening September 7-8 at the Grand Hyatt Washington, Gov 2.0 Summit brings the latest in technology thinking and capabilities to Washington, with fresh voices, cutting edge demos, and thought-provoking conversations. We explore the implications of the latest technology for policy, for the design of government programs, and for the implementation of government technology&amp;nbsp;strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear from industry giants like Cisco, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, Microsoft, and Google, as well as innovative startups like Palantir, drop.io, Slideshare, and more. You’ll also hear from leading government technology implementers and policymakers about their successes, the obstacles they face, and their plans for the future. Simply put, you’ll learn how the latest technology can transform the way you do your job and achieve your&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus this year is on opening the door to innovation — learning about the latest technology and its application, and breaking down the barriers to its&amp;nbsp;adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues you can expect to hear about at Gov 2.0 Summit&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * The Power of Platforms&lt;br /&gt;
    * Fueling the Innovation Economy&lt;br /&gt;
    * Identity, Privacy, and Informed Consent&lt;br /&gt;
    * Cost Savings and Doing More with Less&lt;br /&gt;
    * Empowering Citizens&lt;br /&gt;
    * Improving Government&amp;nbsp;Effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for you to request an invitation to attend this year’s event is now open. Last year’s event was sold out. Submit your request today and reserve your place in the&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Enterprise 2.0 </title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/06/enterprise-20</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Attend the Enterprise 2.0 Conference to learn how collaborative technologies can accelerate information flow and drive&amp;nbsp;revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we work is changing rapidly, offering an enormous competitive advantage to those who embrace the new tools that enable contextual, agile and simplified information exchange and collaboration to distributed workforces and networks of partners and&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise 2.0 is the term for the technologies and business practices that liberate the workforce from the constraints of legacy communication and productivity tools like email. It provides business managers with access to the right information at the right time through a web of inter-connected applications, services and devices. Enterprise 2.0 makes accessible the collective intelligence of many, translating to a huge competitive advantage in the form of increased innovation, productivity and&amp;nbsp;agility.&lt;/p&gt;
