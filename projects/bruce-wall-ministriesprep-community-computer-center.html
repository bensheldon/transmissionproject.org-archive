He has narrowed down that database to a list of the top 20 prospects.  We have used that database and research to provide information on grant opportunities to hundreds of other CTC’s through our E-mail list.  Matthew has developed template grants for both PREP and TechMission that follow the Associated Grantmakers format and other standard formats.  We have made available some of these templates to hundreds of other CTC’s through our E-mail list and on our website to assist them in developing resources and&nbsp;grantwriting.</p>
<p>Matthew has also been working with us in our partnerships with organizations to help provide resources to CTC’s.  Matthew has provided feedback to other CTC’s on their grant applications for free computers to the Beaumont Foundation.  In addition, he has assisted in the review process with the Beaumont Foundation and the Connections for Tomorrow&nbsp;consortium.  </p>
<p>Matt has also been involved in many of the strategy discussions for sustainability for TechMission Inc.  He has assisted us in applying for an AmeriCorps state application and an AmeriCorps national application.  In addition, he has worked with us to secure resources from the Boston Foundation and is assisting us in developing other resources. He has also assisted us in applying for the Department of Education CTC grant, which we were&nbsp;awarded.</p>
<p>We plan to hire Matthew to work for TechMission after completion of his VISTA&nbsp;year.</p>

<p>Margaret has also developed curriculum for our A+ certification class and tested it with over 15 students last semester.  About 5 of her students have returned this semester to volunteer to teach classes.  Margaret has also developed curriculum for our Microsoft Certified System Engineer courses.

<p>Michael has developed training materials for youth in New Horizons and is also teaching classes. Michael has also been assisting with technical support and is still in the process of further developing our documentation around this. Because we cancelled our summer camp this year, Michael was not able to develop any curriculum for the&nbsp;camp.</p>

<p>We would use the Americorps*VISTA member to help run the walk-in computer lab as well as to help assist with some of our classes. In the walk-in lab, the VISTA members would help answer people&#8217;s questions and assist them in their work. They would also work with the youth staff that we have working in the&nbsp;lab.</p>
<p>The VISTA member would also assist in teaching our classes on Saturdays. VISTA members could assist with whatever class that suits their technical&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
<p>The third area VISTA members couls assist in is in providing computer training to youth in our after school program during the afternoon a couple of times a&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Depending on the VISTA member&#8217;s technical capabilities, they may also assist in the technical support of the lab as well as helping work with the youth in our youth-run Web design business. For each of these areas, we would provide the VISTA member with training and mentors to help guide&nbsp;them.</p>

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

“By concentrating on curriculum and training, Gariet made sure that the website would stay useful to the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program beyond just his year with&nbsp;us. </p>
<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
