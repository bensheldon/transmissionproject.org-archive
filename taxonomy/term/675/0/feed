 <title>Show me your publics, and I’ll show you mine</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2011/6/show-me-your-publics-and-i%E2%80%99ll-show-you-mine</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading the title chapter of Michael Warner’s 2002 collection of essays Publics and Counterpublics, I am struck by how the book resonates with my work with the Transmission Project. It has helped me think through and beyond the rhetoric I encounter every&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals in the field speak endlessly of “community-engagement,” “community feedback,” and/or “community opinion.” Recently these terms have been popping up in my research of online vote-for-me contests and in online forums that claim to capture “community opinion” by allowing users to comment on various topics or ideas for change. How these sites describe community action coincides with Warner’s explanation of the normative ways we ascribe agency to a public, an otherwise abstract space for the circulation of&amp;nbsp;ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of the verbs for public agency are verbs for private reading, transposed upward to the aggregate of readers. Readers may scrutinize, ask, reject, opine, decide, judge, and so on. Publics can do exactly these things. And nothing else. Publics – unlike mobs or crowds – are incapable of any activity that cannot be expressed through such a verb. Activities of reading that do not fit the ideology of reading as silent, private, replicable decoding – curling up, mumbling, fantasizing, gesticulating, ventriloquizing, writing marginalia, and so on – also find no counterparts in public agency”&amp;nbsp;(123). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community participation as imagined in many online spaces resembles Warner’s understanding of publics as essentially readerly – able to act only in ways one would act in relation to a text. Innovative as such online tools are, they still render community agency as an interpretive and analytical function and not as specifically collective practice or group action. The Transmission Project has argued on behalf of more expansive definitions of public and media that include as broad as possible a range of approaches of group participation and communication. An open-ended definition is central to the Project’s understanding of how media can transform people’s lived&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar attempt to make room for new imaginings of public life, Warner offers the notion of a counterpublic, which he defines as, “a scene where a dominated group aspires to re-create itself as a public and in doing so finds itself in conflict not only with the dominant social group but with the norms that constitute the dominant culture as a public” (112). Organizations hosting Digital Arts Service Corps members serve people of color, immigrant groups, women, and youth, all of whom could be described as being subject to oppression. However, members’ pre-existing identities or their oppositional stance toward power do not define them as a counterpublic. (More important is how participation in a public shapes or transforms identity.) Rather, Warner suggests, counterpublics are “counter” to the extent that they offer alternative ways of participating in public life. His example of 18th century She-Romps are characterized not by their female membership, but by how these clubs of rowdy women rejected conventions of public politeness and modesty. Counterpublics imagine their terms of membership differently from conventional notions of participation in public&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from the Center for Social Media, one of my favorite quotations that the Transmission Project has used and reused effectively imagines publics as emerging by way of something other than the act of readerly&amp;nbsp;discourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People come in as participants in a media project and leave recognizing themselves as members of a public — a group of people commonly affected by an issue. They have found each other and exchanged information on an issue in which they all see themselves as having a&amp;nbsp;stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating media plays a generative role here beyond conveying the opinions of the creators. The way I read this statement, the newly-formed public does not preexist its members’ participation in an act of co-creation. Rather, participation in creation serves as the condition of membership for the new public. Similarly, the participants’ common stake in an issue did not previously define them as individuals. Membership has transformed their identities. In this example, collective creation of media supersedes private reading as the action that defines the public as such. In this regard, it borrows from models of popular education in which instruction is not delivered down to students who then produce individual responses. Instead, learners share lessons with each other. Because it offers a non-normative vision of participation in public life, the excerpt serves for me as an allegory of transformative public&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what extent do the community media projects your organization runs coincide with Warner’s concept of counterpublics? As community media movements build steam, I hope we continue to think critically about how we imagine participation and forge new forms of engaging in public life. Until then, let the She-Romps&amp;nbsp;romp!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>In Pursuit of New Literacies</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2011/1/in-pursuit-of-new-literacies</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://transmissionproject.org/sites/transmissionproject.org/files/runningMoney.png&quot; width=&quot;510&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of digital citizenship – equal participation in a democratic society through digital media – and the corresponding need for digital and media literacy in communities have attracted increased attention thanks to reports such as the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s National Broadband Plan. In support of these ideals, this and similar documents call for the launch of a national Digital Literacy Corps and for increased capacity building of community-based organizations that deliver digital literacy&amp;nbsp;education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the work of its Digital Arts Service Corps members, the Transmission Project is answering the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s call by building the capacity of organizations that provide digital literacy education. The media literacy and production programs run by these community-based organizations inspire people of all ages and of different racial, cultural, and economic backgrounds to create media that represent their perspectives while addressing issues important to their communities. Even the young participants of these programs are making a difference to their communities’ media landscapes&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://messagesinmotion.com/&quot;&gt; Messages in Motion&lt;/a&gt; is a project of the Termite &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; collective in Philadelphia that puts the tools and skills of video production into the hands of community members who make short “digital postcards” about issues important to them. The videos participants make are then linked to each other based on common themes. Because participants’ creations are both person- and site-specific, the project contributes to a sense of social topography: people are mutually joined by their interest in common issues facing their communities. Even the very young produce films. Participants’ perspectives are unabashedly personal and biased; they do not speak in the detached language of journalism. But by taking part in a dialogue, even these young people can contribute to a sense of community and the exercise of civic&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Other Half of the&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside recommendations that will expand the work of community-based organizations, the National Broadband Plan supports partnerships between public and private sectors as the most efficient way to deliver quality digital literacy across&amp;nbsp;populations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NTIA&lt;/span&gt; should consider supporting public-private partnerships of hardware manufacturers, software companies, broadband service providers and digital literacy training partners to improve broadband adoption and utilization by working with federal agencies already serving non-adopting communities. Congress should consider providing additional public funds, or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NTIA&lt;/span&gt; should use existing funds to support these&amp;nbsp;partnerships…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These partnerships would support the communities hit hardest by poverty. Participants would be eligible to receive discounted technology products, reduced-priced service offerings, basic digital literacy training and ongoing support. In addition, these partnerships would offer customized training, applications and&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 13th, 2010 heralded one of the first of such partnerships. Common Sense Media announced in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101213005296/en/Common-Sense-Media-Verizon-Announce-Partnership-Promote&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that it would be partnering with Verizon on a digital literacy campaign. The nonprofit will share its “digital literacy and citizenship” curriculum with the telecommunications giant’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkfinity.org/&quot;&gt;Thinkfinity&lt;/a&gt; website, and Verizon’s &lt;a href=&quot; http://parentalcontrolcenter.com/&quot;&gt; parentalcontrolcenter.com &lt;/a&gt; will host weekly Common Sense Media blogs and video&amp;nbsp;tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the effectiveness of community-based media initiatives, why would a non-profit organization that, according to its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, believes in the principles of “free and independent media,” “media sanity, not censorship,” and “a diversity of programming and media ownership” choose to ally itself with Verizon, a company that has instituted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/10/04/verizon.fees.overcharge.fcc/index.html?hpt=T2&quot;&gt;anti-consumer practices&lt;/a&gt;, supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://benton.org/node/40458&quot;&gt;unsound and unreliable net neutrality rules&lt;/a&gt;, and launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://colorlines.com/archives/2010/08/air_has_no_prejudice_but_verizon_does.html&quot;&gt;powerfully misleading ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt;? What can we expect to develop out of this&amp;nbsp;partnership?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Does Common Sense Tell&amp;nbsp;Us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at the curricula that this partnership will promote demonstrates just how divorced Verizon and Common Sense Media’s use of digital literacy concepts is from the actual community work and educational reform that digital literacy and citizenship&amp;nbsp;entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Sense Media’s curricula comprise tools for parents and educators – not kids – to combat the potential hazards of Internet use among children and adolescents and to provide youth with age-appropriate media experiences.  Lessons on how to monitor and control kids’ media experiences and teach them to participate “appropriately” online epitomize the organization’s fearful stance vis-à-vis media. A unit on “Connected Culture” purports to explore “the ethics of participating in and building positive online communities,” but focuses almost exclusively on the threat of cyber bullying.  Pervasive fear characterizes the &lt;a href= &quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/browse/video?type=csm_curriculum_lesson&amp;amp;grade[0]=48259&amp;amp;grade[1]=48260&amp;amp;grade[2]=48261&amp;amp;unit[0]=1823&amp;amp;unit[1]=1835&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that introduces the unit as positive online interactions among teenagers are twisted into instances of harassment with the help of music and editing. Given Common Sense&amp;#8217;s paranoid perspective on media, the positive and negative aspects of online interaction can hardly receive equal&amp;nbsp;treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Sense Media has allowed fear of media misuse to over-determine its understanding of digital literacy. Although questions of online etiquette and safety certainly deserve attention, the nonprofit&amp;#8217;s fear-based stance toward Media results in an approach to digital literacy education that is not only anti-media, but also anti-child. Consequently, the measures it recommends remain prescriptive and precautionary, not reparative or transformative: filter what content your child sees, punish kids for violating the rules you establish, teach them to behave properly online. Despite Common Sense Media’s claim that it upholds digital media as a platform for community involvement, participation in community is reduced to being a polite citizen and literacy is reduced to knowing how to follow codes of&amp;nbsp;conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides adhering to the guidelines the site prescribes, children have little to no role to play in Common Sense&amp;#8217;s vision of online civic life. For instance, the site bemoans the ubiquity of sexual imagery in the media and the insidiousness of advertisements disguised as entertainment targeting youth, but does little to discuss how the media might be changed and what role young people can play in this transformation. According to the organization’s beliefs, restricting children&amp;#8217;s access to media and making better-informed decisions about media consumption can transform the media landscape. When the website does &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/creating-digital-media#&quot;&gt; celebrate kids’ creativity&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot do so without touting the same cautionary reminders. Only if kids follow the rules may their creativity “some day make the world a better&amp;nbsp;place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided Common Sense Media’s protection- and consumer-based methods, its willingness to partner with Verizon seems only logical. Verizon’s Parent Control Center website sells worried parents tools for tracking children’s online behavior. (The Family Locator, Usage Controls, and Security Suite are available to Verizon customers for an additional $4.99 to $9.99/month). The anxious perspective that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSM&lt;/span&gt; conveys can only increase the perceived need for such tools. More importantly, Common Sense Media’s parent-focused, passive approach to media reform aids Verizon’s misappropriation of the concepts of digital literacy and digital citizenship. In practice, these concepts call for teaching kids about the media industry itself, including issues of media ownership, affordability, and other barriers to inclusion in online economies as well as how they can change the structure of the media industry to be more accountable to them. By championing the causes of digital literacy and citizenship without tackling Verizon’s role in maintaining barriers to adoption, the telecomm giant and its public sector partner implicate themselves in a travesty of the concepts. Digital literacy demands more than a 21st century update to the Golden&amp;nbsp;Rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Media as an Answer, not an&amp;nbsp;Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is Common Sense Media’s philosophy a legitimate insistence on age-appropriate lessons for kids who are too young to understand media bias and ownership, or does it signal ignorance of the difficult, multifaceted work that underlies teaching media literacy while underestimating what young people can&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Termite’s Messages in Motion, the curricula taught at organizations hosting Digital Arts Service Corps members stand in stark contrast to the lessons of Common Sense Media. Rather than offering prescriptive advice for parents, their youth programs show respect for people’s different identities and ignite the creativity of young people to share their perspectives. Ashley was a participant in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIM&lt;/span&gt;’s mobile media production studio. Compare her video about her neighborhood with Common Sense Media’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/advice-for-parents/creating-digital-media&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Digital Creation&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; presentation. How can &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSM&lt;/span&gt; claim to promote civic engagement if its proposed solutions only go so far as curtailing kids’ behavior and changing consumer habits? Messages in Motion, on the other hand, forges a connection between creativity and social&amp;nbsp;justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://messagesinmotion.com/2010/12/people-should-stop-doing-drugs/&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://transmissionproject.org/sites/transmissionproject.org/files/Snapshot 2011-01-19 10-46-10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/sacyes&quot;&gt;SacYES&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative of the Center for Multicultural Collaboration, which has locations in Fresno and Sacramento, California. Program participants are graduates of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMC&lt;/span&gt;’s after-school production courses and are paid to make videos, provide technology trainings, and create social media that assists public sector organizations. SacYES and its Fresno counterpart FresYES demonstrate that young people can both create media relevant to social issues and become leaders in their&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Media Literacy Project’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://medialiteracyproject.org/programs/digital-justice-for-us&quot;&gt;Digital Justice for Us&lt;/a&gt; campaign proves that youth can understand media ownership and bias by relating them to their everyday lives. Inner-city youth from Albuquerque record their conversations with peers from rural areas with poor broadband infrastructure. They deploy media to demonstrate how the social ramifications of any medium influence messages conveyed through it. This self-referential use of media is central to any comprehensive notion of digital&amp;nbsp;literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/aEB87RPolHU?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What This Means for Corporate Partnerships and Digital&amp;nbsp;Literacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juxtaposing Common Sense Media’s online lessons with community-based approaches emphasizes the inadequacies of public-private models of digital literacy education. Insofar as digital citizenship connotes the extension of civic life to the digital realm, digital literacy efforts will necessarily include components that address how the same racial, cultural, and economic prejudices that exist offline also impact communication online. Sites like Messages in Motion’s can only serve as forums for community discussion if accessible to all. Digital literacy demands that organizations mobilize their constituencies in pursuit of media justice and universal access to information and communications technologies. The leaders in digital literacy education are doing so through the creative use of digital media itself. Unless Common Sense Media and Verizon can meet the same demands, their lessons are a false promise of digital literacy and&amp;nbsp;citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is the case with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSM&lt;/span&gt;, organizations that claim to promote increased civic engagement across populations through digital media may not recognize what the different needs of communities are, let alone acknowledge that a variety of approaches is required. Based on Verizon’s choice of partners, it seems big companies will ally themselves with organizations whose curricula only reflect the concerns of the company&amp;#8217;s current customers, not the growing diversity of Internet technology adopters. The impotence of this particular partnership to meet the digital literacy needs of communiteis casts doubt on the ability of future partnerships to fulfill the role laid out for them in the National Broadband&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects and initiatives mentioned here only scratch the surface of the youth programming undertaken at current and former Digital Arts Service Corps sites, and many organizations provide youth programming besides digital video production training, such as online journalism and radio.

 <title>Technology, Social Innovation, and Civic Participation: What&#039;s the Next Step?</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/12/technology-social-innovation-and-civic-participation-whats-the-next-step</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Disaster, fraud and crime reporting sites provide information to civic authorities. AmberAlert has more than 7 million users who help with information on child abductions, and SERVE.GOV enables citizens to volunteer for national parks, museums and other institutions. These are just a few examples of digital tools &amp;#8211; from social networking applications, to microblogging (e.g. Twitter), to recommendation sites like Ushahidi &amp;#8211; that represent the new frontier of technology-mediated social participation. Whether dealing with a natural disaster, expanding health care coverage, or campaigning to make a forest a national landmark, governments and private citizens alike have found digital tools to be an effective means of reaching the&amp;nbsp;masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also clear challenges when using technology in this realm, including limited scale and potential privacy violations. Please join us as we build on two recent National Science Foundation workshops to discuss the advantages and pitfalls of social innovation and civic participation in this brave new technology-mediated&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
