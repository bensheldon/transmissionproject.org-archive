                <span class="field-content"><p>The VISTA worker at SCAT would spearhead the effort to more fully integrate web-based services into SCAT&#8217;s operations. For example, we would like to provide an interactive program schedule on the Website, and provide producers with the option to archive their programs on our website to allow for video-on-demand.  The VISTA would also help us transition to wireless connections for all our office&nbsp;computers. </p>
<p>The VISTA would work with local non-profit organizations on outreach projects, both in video and on the Web. The VISTA would train staff and members in video and web design&nbsp;skills.</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Christy helped out with programing, including a monthly show called Talking About Somerville. She set up the lighting and manned (womanned) a camera and then edited the peice together putting titles and credits and music to&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>Christy attends local events around Boston interviewing and filming the community. She is currently working with one of our interns to start a show about the &#8220;issues&#8221; facing artists in somerville. She is hoping that anything from the cost of studio space to art education in public schools will be addressed. She has met with the host of another art show we do at SCAT to discuss the format of the&nbsp;show.</p>
<p>Christy is also teaching digital media courses to youth including a class on audio recording and garage band and a program called &#8220;Say Media!&#8221; where youth create music videos, PSAs, and&nbsp;documentaries.</p>
<p>Christy told us, &#8220;I have really enjoyed working with all of them. Some of them have really gotten into their projects and will stay several hours after the camp is through to finish up. they are pretty motivated (they should be, they get paid more than i do to teach, just to show up :) and they are producing some really neat youth media that will appear on our&nbsp;station.&#8221;</p>

<p>VISTA responsibilities&nbsp;include</p>
<p>Planning and policy work:<br />
Research how other public access stations have &#8220;crossed the digital divide&#8221; and implemented computer center programs, as well as programs related to the new digital video technologies, make recommendations to SCAT staff and Board of Directors, and help implement the plan, which would include the purchase of some&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p>Outreach:<br />
Collaboration on the development of messages and programming for the public access channel aimed at making people aware of the new resources and programs at SCAT; development of printed outreach material; personal outreach work, such as visiting service agencies, youth groups, community associations, etc., with a translator when&nbsp;necessary</p>
<p>Training Program:<br />
Design and implementation of a creative program of training on the computer stations, especially related to the Internet and to the multimedia possibilities offered by the world wide web; collaboration with SCAT staff who work with the non-linear editing system in the design and implementation of new multimedia training courses; design and implementation of an advanced training program related to web site design, video streaming,&nbsp;etc.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>SCAT currently has two computer stations that will soon be linked to the Internet, and will be dedicated solely to community members, and we hope to have a high speed cable modem connection soon. The VISTA volunteer&#8217;s work would revolve around helping move SCAT into the &#8220;digital age&#8221; without leaving behind anyone in the Somerville communities SCAT has been serving for over 25 years: at risk youth, immigrant communities, low- and middle-income people, and organizations who feel ignored by the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media, and seniors looking for a way to make their voices and concerns heard. The concrete activities would include but not be limited to the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p>Planning and policy work: Research how other public access stations have &#8220;crossed the digital divide&#8221; and implemented computer center programs, as well as programs related to the new digital video technologies. Make recommendations to SCAT staff and Board of Directors, and help implement the plan, which would include the purchase of some&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p>Outreach: Collaboration on the development of messages and programming for the public access channel aimed at making people aware of the new resources and programs at SCAT; development of printed outreach material personal outreach work, such as visiting service agencies, youth groups, community associations, etc., with a translator where&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>Training programs: Design and implementation of a creative program of training on the computer stations, especially related to the internet and to the multimedia possibilities offered by the WWW; collaboration with SCAT staff who work with the non-linear editing system in the design and implementation of new multimedia training courses design and implementation of an advanced training program related to web site design, video streaming,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Impact: It is hoped that this new facet of SCAT&#8217;s work will have many different impacts for low-income youth and adults, from both the English-speaking, and the non-English -speaking communities, including but not limited to: concrete, career-related training, increased accessing of the resources available through the internet; a dynamic new addition to SCAT television programming; the development of a dynamic multimedia program, where teh assets and opportunities of public access television and the internet are combined and made accessible to&nbsp;all.</p>

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
