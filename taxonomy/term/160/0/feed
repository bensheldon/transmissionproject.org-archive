 <title>Technology, Social Innovation, and Civic Participation: What&#039;s the Next Step?</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/12/technology-social-innovation-and-civic-participation-whats-the-next-step</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Disaster, fraud and crime reporting sites provide information to civic authorities. AmberAlert has more than 7 million users who help with information on child abductions, and SERVE.GOV enables citizens to volunteer for national parks, museums and other institutions. These are just a few examples of digital tools &amp;#8211; from social networking applications, to microblogging (e.g. Twitter), to recommendation sites like Ushahidi &amp;#8211; that represent the new frontier of technology-mediated social participation. Whether dealing with a natural disaster, expanding health care coverage, or campaigning to make a forest a national landmark, governments and private citizens alike have found digital tools to be an effective means of reaching the&amp;nbsp;masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also clear challenges when using technology in this realm, including limited scale and potential privacy violations. Please join us as we build on two recent National Science Foundation workshops to discuss the advantages and pitfalls of social innovation and civic participation in this brave new technology-mediated&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, December 1, 2010&lt;br /&gt;
3:30 p.m. - 4:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New America Foundation&lt;br /&gt;
1899 L St. NW, Suite 400&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Gov 2.0 Summit</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/09/gov-20-summit</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gov 2.0 Summit brings together innovators from government and the private sector to highlight technology and ideas that can be applied to the nation’s great challenges. In areas as diverse as education, health care, energy, jobs, and financial reform, there are unique opportunities to rethink how government agencies perform their mission and serve our citizens. Social media, cloud computing, web, and mobile technologies—all provide new capabilities that government agencies are beginning to harness to achieve demonstrably better results at lower&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happening September 7-8 at the Grand Hyatt Washington, Gov 2.0 Summit brings the latest in technology thinking and capabilities to Washington, with fresh voices, cutting edge demos, and thought-provoking conversations. We explore the implications of the latest technology for policy, for the design of government programs, and for the implementation of government technology&amp;nbsp;strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear from industry giants like Cisco, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, Microsoft, and Google, as well as innovative startups like Palantir, drop.io, Slideshare, and more. You’ll also hear from leading government technology implementers and policymakers about their successes, the obstacles they face, and their plans for the future. Simply put, you’ll learn how the latest technology can transform the way you do your job and achieve your&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus this year is on opening the door to innovation — learning about the latest technology and its application, and breaking down the barriers to its&amp;nbsp;adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues you can expect to hear about at Gov 2.0 Summit&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * The Power of Platforms&lt;br /&gt;
    * Fueling the Innovation Economy&lt;br /&gt;
    * Identity, Privacy, and Informed Consent&lt;br /&gt;
    * Cost Savings and Doing More with Less&lt;br /&gt;
    * Empowering Citizens&lt;br /&gt;
    * Improving Government&amp;nbsp;Effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for you to request an invitation to attend this year’s event is now open. Last year’s event was sold out. Submit your request today and reserve your place in the&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
