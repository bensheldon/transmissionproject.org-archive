<p>Duke University currently provides one person to oversee technical support for community tech centers in Durham. The AmeriCorps*VISTA member will work with this person and other members of the tech support committee to plan and develop a working technology support&nbsp;group.</p>
<p>The VISTA member will identify and document support services to be provided by the TACT support committee, develop an expertise list that the Help Desk will use to forward problems, develop lists of recommended hardware and software for technology centers, as well as installing and troubleshooting computer systems and providing routine&nbsp;maintenance.</p>

Similarly, when there is a problem, the inventories will give tech support people preliminary information that will facilitate&nbsp;troubleshooting.</p>

                    <p>Currently the Media Aid Center provides during and afterschool digital media production courses for five high schools in South Los Angeles supporting large underserved and disadvantaged communities. The center supplies mobile media labs and studio facility to support community engagement and youth involvement&nbsp;activities.</p>
<p>The school site managers will be in charge of recruiting, training, supporting, scheduling, and recognizing non-AmeriCorps mentors and volunteers. The developer will ensure the appropriate orientation and accommodations have been made for each site to make volunteers within their Media curriculum. This includes developing field trip curricula and mentor-lead exercises as a part of the Media curriculum. The site managers will act as liaisons and mediators between the sites and the school. Media instruction will be framed as a tool to facilitate academic achievement, community involvement, exploration and&nbsp;expression.</p>

                    <p>The website remained incomplete. Some of the problem was the delay in training Mike properly. Mike acted as site manager at our main facility. This freed our staff to massively exspand our capacity from 100 students to 700 students per year. He planned and accompanied students on field trips. Mike also developed a website for us. He began a music develop project by converting one of our older computers into a beat&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p>Originally, web development was Mike&#8217;s primary task, but it is his work as a site manager that made the difference. It began with an outreach program to community schools. The schools stated they needed the program during school not after, and we have been growing fast ever&nbsp;since.</p>

We have begun to put the Plan in place by building a new &#8220;Mapping the Field&#8221; database; preparing for&nbsp;2007</p>
<p>For the 2007 Technology Infrastructure/Content Development Project  we ask the VISTA volunteer&nbsp;to:</p>
<p>1.  Manage and contribute to NAMAC&#8217;s 2007 technology planning project which will help our membership connect and work with each other more fully across the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>2.  Develop NAMAC&#8217;s website, with special attention to building it out with Web 2.0&nbsp;platforms.</p>
<p>3.  Assist program staff in creating a variety of new content and participatory areas of the web&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>4.  Contribute to helping the national media arts community to build capacity through online participatory&nbsp;technologies.</p>
<p>5.  Work with program staff to upgrade our website with a new &#8220;look and&nbsp;feel.&#8221; </p>
<p>6.  Work with programming staff to build out the online historical &#8220;media arts movement&#8221;&nbsp;timeline.</p>

                    <p>Morgan&#8217;s primary focus has been on the complete redesign of the NAMAC website &#8211; from complex technical programming to taxonomization of data and content to social networking and blogging. It launched in the end of August and is becoming the nervous system of the NAMAC offerings. We are very happy with the results and look forward to our next phase of community building online, educating our membership in social networking through the site, and extending its reach to other nonprofits, communities and the public. Morgan has been a kind, reponsive and patient staff member throughout this process, always thinking strategically about how our online offerings can benefit new members, communities and&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>Morgan wrote an article about the website-building process for our member newsletter and produced a short video on how to use the site to its maximum capability. Now he is transitioning into the role of online community manager. He is managing our website content, troubleshooting any technical problems, and most importantly creating an online community of dedicated users from the NAMAC membership and other nonprofits, to the public&nbsp;at-large.</p>
<p>It was a hard challenge to solve a lot of the technical problems that the transistion to a Drupal environment posed. But we were very pleased to see that not only was Morgan a problem solver, but he was a solution seeker, reaching out continuously to the technical community and his network of programmers to find ways to deal with the small to large issues that would&nbsp;arise.</p>

                    <p>hrough our after school programs and community organizing initiatives, we strive to develop the skills of youth and adult residents so that they are empowered to enhance their own lives and build a stronger urban community.  We serve over 500 youth and their families annually directly through our programs, which&nbsp;include:  </p>
<p>•School-based after-school and summer programs for area elementary and middle school students<br />
•A Paths to Career and College Program for over 125 middle and high school students that includes one-to-one mentoring, tutoring, career and college planning, and SAT Prep.<br />
•Youth leadership and youth organizing programs for teens<br />
•Youth workforce development programs<br />
•A Parent Engagement Initiative for Boston Public School parents<br />
•A Latin and Hip-Hop Dance program and a variety of recreation programs<br />
•Cultural and Arts programs for youth and&nbsp;parents</p>
<p>The CTC VISTA Project will support the inclusion / expansion of technology as a component of all of our youth and community development programs.  Computer / Internet literacy and proficiency in other technology applications are now part of the &#8220;basic literacy&#8221; expected of all high school graduates, in order to succeed higher education and professionally.  Computers and the Internet have also become indispensable tools for a range of music and artistic pursuits.  Technology applications such as digital video and photography and web page development are also useful learning and communications tools across a variety of disciplines, including arts, literacy and community development.  &#8220;Activating&#8221; technology in our youth and community development programs will provide an essential tool as our youth develop their voice and vision for personal success, civic participation, and community&nbsp;building.</p>

He worked with youth to set up for the Clubhouse&#8217;s first Open House which was held in early April. He is also supporting the Youth Literacy Tutors program in creating fliers for a community event that the youth will be hosting in May. Wes also attended the NTEN conference in&nbsp;March.</p>
<p>Wes finished working with youth to create new website for HSTF Music Clubhhouse and continues supporting youth in utilizing technology in the music program particularly to create original compositions and&nbsp;arrangements.</p>
<p>Because Wes&#8217; direct supervisor is not involved in technology implementation on a day-to-day basis, it often means that Wes has to &#8220;fend for himself&#8221; in working with program staff. To help alleviate this issue, Wes and his supervisor are now meeting on a more frequent schedule and his supervisor will take a more active role in troubleshooting any communication gaps between Wes and program&nbsp;staff.</p>

<p>•	Leverage existing and new tools/content/resources to enhance website/discussion list/newsletter and related&nbsp;services</p>
<p>•	Develop a more systematic, integrated way of identifying and/or creating resources for YouthLearn community and broader&nbsp;field</p>

She has converted our discussion list to a new format using mailman software that offers us much easier facilitation.  She has created a member database where we are able to collect feedback from our community as well as demographic information.  Lauren also created an incredibly effective blog format for our online newsletter that can be continually updated by any member of our team and automatically delivered to subscribers on a regular basis.

The principle advantage MVhub.com has over other sites is that dedicated staff is not required to keep the site up to date.  The process for reminding organizations to update their records is largely&nbsp;automated.</p>
<p>Erik completed Leslie Koplow&#8217;s graphic design, worked with David Siegal on the search engine and worked with Felicia Sullivan in integrating a community calendar and tidying up various&nbsp;templates.</p>
<p>Erik also contributed&nbsp;to</p>
<p>- Completing Incremental Backups<br />
- Refine Use of Visitors Reports<br />
- Implement New Website Design<br />
- Formstore Configuration File Generation<br />
- Mapping Configuration File To An Array<br />
- Webmail HVHUB Banners<br />

<p>Other improvements to the look of our site included:<br />
• the random display logos and pictures from our sponsors.<br />
• A RSS feed from slashdot. (headlines)<br />
• XHTML 1.0&nbsp;compliance.</p>
