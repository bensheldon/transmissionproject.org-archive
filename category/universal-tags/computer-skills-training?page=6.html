                    <p>Victoria concentrated efforts this year on stabilizing community computer class offerings to reach adult community members in Mattawa, Royal City, and Othello. The first half of her term was spent generating community computer classes, developing more classes in each community, and training volunteers through Central Washington University (CWU) GEARUP.  The second half of the term was focused on expanding that interest to self-study and home use, and to continue the access to learning.  During the course of the year, over 130 users were involved in introductory computer classes and intermediate level classes.  Students logged roughly 1400 user hours.  Among other things, these classes built community capacity, strengthened a cadre of volunteers, and led BBCC to develop partnerships and open new computer classes in Mattawa, Royal City and Othello that were geared to second language&nbsp;learners.</p>

                    <p>Victoria refined and implemented a second language (Spanish) curriculum that was used in the computer classes.  She based the curriculum on research done with a variety of programs working with second language students.  CWU GEARUP linked with Victoria to provide work study students to teach computer classes in the three communities.  CWU recruited bilingual campus students who then taught the computer classes under the guidance of the VISTA program.   One of the CWU GEARUP program objectives is to increase knowledge and awareness of post secondary education for the families with children in these three communities.  Increasing the family’s access to technology is a link to their literacy growth and improves success in school.  Victoria also developed a strong relationship with the RECA Foundation in Kennewick and continued to link community members to the foundation so they could purchase refurbished computers at a low cost for their home use.  We have learned that real progress for most students is dependant on computers in the home.  Victoria was able to get computers into many of the student’s homes in Royal City and Mattawa and to help them keep these computers working.  The computers are geared more towards families and give kids a basis for learning.  They have security in place to prevent major problems from occurring to the operating system.  The major drawback in these computers is that they do not allow changes to the system and prevent use of the internet.  However, as a beginning computer for families, they are perfect because they aren’t susceptible to viruses as they become more comfortable with the computers, they can later invest in one that is Internet ready. In the meantime, Internet access and ESL software remains available in the community&nbsp;labs.</p>

She is an enormous asset to both the organization and the communities in which she has demonstrated her talent and good&nbsp;will.</p>

                    <p>Ria has done a good job of connecting with schools and organizations to<br />
create alliances for projects and for recruitment. Ria hasalso  been wonderfully effective at recruiting guest speakers and field trip hosts for&nbsp;GGD.</p>
<p>Ria has done a wonderful job of preparing program information for the public, including the fall GGD update (sent to funders and partner agencies) and the December graduation flier. Because the program’s outreach has been so successful, there has not been a need for the extensive outreach we have had in the&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>I believe Ria’s work on program curriculum and her work in the classroom will be one of her greatest legacies in the program. She has developed strong curricula and has led successful, creative classes. She has developed curriculum for and taught the fall and spring classes and has developed a proposal for a summer video program. Her teaching style with the students has been steadily improving, and her comfort level and ability in working with students in and out of the classroom has been a pleasure to watch&nbsp;grow.</p>

                    <p>CHA and DSSA develop Computer Learning Centers(CLCs) for residents at assigned public housing projects, including those who serve seniors and disabled&nbsp;adults.</p>
<p>Dan Killian replaced Alycia Alexander, as she moved to a full-time position with DSSA at the end of her VISTA year.  Dan came to Sheridan Devon Apartments on the North Side.  Sheridan Devon also was on its way to being self-sustaining, so Dan, like Ted, split his time between two buildings.  Dan worked in Pomeroy Apartments CLC a few blocks away until the Fisher and Pomeroy CLCs were combined this&nbsp;summer.</p>
<p>Dan came with a background in Russian and Uzbek languages, and he began to learn Urdu in the evenings.  Working in buildings with mostly elderly immigrants, his language skills got plenty of practice.  He began to translate curricula, though this proved to be a difficult&nbsp;task.</p>

                    <p>Dan has worked to make connections in the community to expand the CLC beyond the building itself.  He has worked with Loyola University Chicago, specifically Hillel and Loyola Chicago, building on relationships Alycia Alexander started with them last year.  Dan also has built relationships with the Korean American Community Services, CAAELII, The First Bytes Club, and the Bosnian-Herzegovinian American Community Center.  Dan invited guests from this organization to see our CLC, and he toured their centers to see how we could benefit each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>Our best result so far has been the increase in resident volunteers, volunteers who live in the buildings who have gone through computer workshops and who are now sharing what they learned with others.  Many of them had never touched a computer before last year; this year they are&nbsp;teachers!</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, Dan received a job offer in Washington, D.C. that he could not refuse, so he left us at the end of August.  His departure spurred the residents into action because the survival of their CLC depended upon their participation.  Residents who previously had not participated very regularly became dependable volunteers and participate on the Steering&nbsp;Committee.</p>

                    <p>Abby’s year with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE) was characterized by a  transition of the project  from a previous role of working in traditional classrooms to a new service area involving after-school programming for at risk children. Over half of the jobs MoLLIE took in the 2004-05 school year were at after school centers run by the School district in conjunction with the city Parks and Recreation&nbsp;Department.</p>
<p>MoLLIE taught participating children how to write, shoot, and edit, for cablecast, their own curriculum-linked skits, PSAs, and mini documentaries.  As a MoLLIE trainer/technician, Abby was essential to the success of those&nbsp;programs.</p>

            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>Other ongoing projects that Abby was crucial to the success of&nbsp;included:</p>
<p>- “Project Safe Neighborhoods” (U.S. Department of Justice) in which Abby facilitated the efforts of local youths at neighborhood associations and community centers in writing, shooting, performing, and editing their own Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on the subject of gun violence&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>-  Wedgwood Christian Services of West Michigan.  Similar to PSN, the Wedgwood project involved providing at-risk teens with the tools, training, and  means of transmission to create their own mini documentaries and PSAs focusing on substance abuse&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>Both of these long term projects have been very successful due in large part to Abby’s commitment, diligence, professionalism, expertise, and willingness to work with at risk&nbsp;teens.</p>
<p>Abby’s final, and perhaps most lasting project, done in conjunction with previous VISTA/Americorps volunteers Laura Craig-Bennett, Amy McKenzie, and Jennifer Harris, has been the editing of a four-episode series of documentaries entitled “Girls to Governors” which commemorates the role of  Michigan women in politics.  Funded locally by the Nokomis foundation of Grand Rapids, the VISTA/Americorps producers of “Girls to Governors” seized upon the election in 2001 of Michigan&#8217;s first female governor, to examine the emerging role of women in local, state, and national politics and public&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>The editing of this series was the capstone event in and outstanding year of service provided by VISTA volunteer Abby Balazs.  The VISTA program should be very proud to have Abby as an alumnae just as we are proud to have had her as an employee and team&nbsp;mate.</p>

She is enthusiastic and very effective as a teacher, especially in a one-on-one setting.  She has a warmth and a focus that children are very responsive to. Abby is setting a very high standard of performance in all aspects of her job with MoLLIE, and I am happy to have her as a member of the&nbsp;team.</p>

                    <p>CHA and DSSA develop Computer Learning Centers(CLCs) for residents at assigned public housing projects, including those who serve seniors and disabled&nbsp;adults.</p>
<p>VISTA member Ted Simpao began his year of service at the Lincoln Perry Computer Learning Center.  As that site was on its way to self-sustainability, Ted agreed to help part-time at New Englewood Terrace (NET), where DSSA and CHA were starting a new CLC.  NET will be a new kind of building, with wireless technology throughout.  Ted works very hard, splitting his time working at CLCs in two DSSA buildings on Chicago’s South&nbsp;Side.</p>

                    <p>Many of the regular users at NET are children and young mothers looking for work. Ted has worked with Jonas, Frank and the building staff at NET to create curriculum to suit this population best. They have created résumé workshops and taught residents how to search for jobs on the Internet.  Children who live at NET love to work with educational game software like the Arthur programs, which help them in&nbsp;school.</p>
<p>Ted gives students at Lincoln Perry CLC hands-on demonstrations during his regular lessons.  He demonstrates what he is explaining, and he creates handouts with digital photos of his demonstrations to reiterate the lessons.  This has been an ingenious creation, because he can show more easily than he can explain what he wants them to learn.  We have adopted that idea for use at other CLCs too, especially in places where most of the computer users’ first language is not&nbsp;English.</p>
<p>Ted has brought Welfare to Work program participants into the building offices and into the Computer Learning Center.  Their assistance has been a great boon for Ted and the office staff, plus it allows the participants opportunities to gain new skills and&nbsp;experience.</p>

                    <p>Our project to date has had good results, we finished last years with the Bridges to Digital Excellence (BDE) program donating 742 total computers and training to students in grades three through eight.  As of today we are at 793 Families that have completed our program.  Becky has done a good job of running operations for the Computers in the Home part of&nbsp;BDE.</p>
<p>As of the beginning of this year’s program which started the last week of February Becky has managed all aspects of the program except purchasing of computers. As I did when we first started the BDE program there were some bumps in the road but things came together.  The same has happed with Becky leading the Computers In the Home program now.  I have full confidence in her abilities to continue the excellence and maintain standards that we strive for.  Our one outlying goal is to have the program we put on compete with the best programs in the world.  To my knowledge there is not another program in the country that is striving to bridge the digital divide as quickly and efficiently as this program is.  We are estimating that by the end of next year every child across Berrien County in grades three through eight will have a computer in their home.  We know that with the 793 families that have completed the program we have had 1586 people in the program and that more than 3000 individuals have been indirectly affected by the BDE program providing technology to so many homes. We want to see Becky continue to take advantage of the wealth of passion for the work we do. At our monthly steering committee meetings she gets to sit with the upper level IT management from almost every major employer in our community.  She has been exposed to a brainstorming technique that was developed by Whirlpool Corp. called an &#8220;Ideation Session&#8221; and how it can be used to expel ideas from a group that are there but people just don’t realize.  Becky also worked on a project for a development company; she wrote a proposal for a local art house to integrate technology into&nbsp;storytelling.</p>
<p>In her second year, Becky has effectively taken on all operations of the computers in the home program and is doing a good job running the program.  We are looking forward to reaching our 1000th family by the end of&nbsp;2005.</p>

                    <p>Goal I. Develop a Computer Learning Center (CLC) for residents at assigned public housing projects that include seniors and disabled&nbsp;adults.</p>
<p>Goal II. Abate historical animosity between residents and their neighbors, the CLC becomes a hub of activity for the surrounding&nbsp;neighborhood.</p>
<p>Goal III. Residents Contribute to the maintenance of the CLC in exchange for access to&nbsp;it</p>
<p>Goal IV. Rather than a top-down approach where staff guesses what the community wants from their CLC, the VISTA member will meet regularly with a steering committee to determine the needs of the community being&nbsp;served.</p>
<p>Goal V.  Develop a plan for technical support using free community resources. Find volunteers from schools that have community service&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>Goal VI.  Teach Basic Computer Skills to all interested residents and community&nbsp;participants.</p>

                    <p>Goal I.<br />
– The CLCs are welcoming and open at least five days per week.  Most of the time, the CLCs see a steady stream of visitors.<br />
– Volunteer meetings at newest CLCs are not yet regular.<br />
– Time is divided among CLCs, but VISTAs commit at least two days per week per CLC.<br />
– Resident volunteers have organized their own schedule<br />
– We would like to do another Quarterly Volunteer Recognition Event in&nbsp;October.</p>
<p>Goal II.<br />
– Has been successful on the North Side and is growing on the South Side.<br />
– VISTAs continuing Alycia&#8217;s work will pursue this&nbsp;further</p>
<p>Goal III.<br />
- Resident volunteers have increased their participation in teaching each other.  The VISTAs have helped to move self-sustainability forward.<br />
– Local students visit our CLCs.  Children who use the CLC get individualized attention from volunteers and VISTAs.<br />
– At our newest CLCs, the largest group of new users is comprised of school-aged children.<br />
– Resident volunteers have not yet adopted this project as their own; it runs with VISTA&nbsp;guidance.</p>
<p>Goal IV.<br />
– Steering Committees meet regularly and report on their&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>Goal V.<br />
– Our volunteers teach computer programs but we have yet to find reliable volunteer technicians.<br />
– The heads of local service learning organizations have met key residents and building staff.<br />
- Steering Committee is no longer holding regular elections in favor of Asses-Based Community Development, in which community members hold positions based on their pre-existing&nbsp;skills</p>
<p>Goal VI.<br />
– We have worked more on “teaching the teachers” this year, which has given the users themselves more pride in their&nbsp;CLC.</p>
<p>Goal VII.<br />
- This project has been building slowly.  We would like to make it a higher priority in the&nbsp;future.</p>

He is also working on curricula for youth for Web design and graphics design. He is in the process of finalizing his curriculum materials and training a replacement staff&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>Michael is also developing a curriculum for the computer club up and helping to teach&nbsp;classes.</p>
<p>Michael has developed training materials for youth in New Horizons and is also teaching classes. Michael has also been assisting with technical support and is still in the process of further developing our documentation around this. Because we cancelled our summer camp this year, Michael was not able to develop any curriculum for the&nbsp;camp.</p>

                    <p>Gregory Fleischer continues to develop and teach multimedia classes at CAMINOS. This semester we have expanded our multimedia opportunities to include animation (Macromedia’s Flash), Video Editing (Windows Movie Maker and Apple’s Quicktime) and interactive media (Macromedia’s&nbsp;Director).</p>
<p>Goal 1:  To provide access to technology to the low-income Latino&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Goal 2:  To provide access to better job opportunities with living&nbsp;wages.</p>
<p>Goal 3:  Public and private sector resources will enable the project to continue after the member&nbsp;leaves.</p>

                    <p>Gregory has designed an exciting new curriculum as well as a long-term multimedia plan for the school. Students truly enjoy and benefit from these classes and we look forward to building on this aspect of our program in the future. The students welcome the creative outlets these classes provide as a balance to the MS office applications and the technical computer repair classes we offer. As previously reported, this instruction has been given not only to students but to staff as&nbsp;well. </p>
<p>In the web design class students continue to work on non-profit site projects under Gregory’s advisory oversight. Several students are now independently building and maintaining websites for neighborhood non-profit&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>Gregory has almost completed the Spanish mirror of our bi-lingual website and he remains solely responsible for the web presence and staff accounts. He continues to work with staff and students in completing and maintaining CAMINOS’ website.
