                    <p>Our core media arts education program, The Lab, is a free after-school workshop that challenges Brooklyn high school students to produce short documentary videos about their lives.  This program incorporates lessons in literacy (story-telling, scripting, editing), self-esteem and tolerance, technology and media literacy within the context of 1:1 mentoring with professional&nbsp;filmmakers.</p>
<p>The Lab Assistant will work with the Lab Coordinator, Directors, and other staff to enhance the capacity of The Lab, Reel Impact, and all other programs of Reel Works Teen Filmmaking. Duties include, but are not limited&nbsp;to</p>
<p>- media arts&nbsp;instruction;</p>
<p>- maintenance of technical equipment and media&nbsp;collection;</p>
<p>- assisting with the recruitment and training of volunteer filmmaker&nbsp;mentors;</p>
<p>- developing and maintaining relationships with schools, community centers, and neighborhoods in Brooklyn served by Reel&nbsp;Works;</p>
<p>- developing a youth advisory&nbsp;board;</p>
<p>- assisting with the distribution/outreach and public&nbsp;relations;</p>
<p>- and performing various administrative duties as&nbsp;needed.</p>

                    <p>In a lab used mainly by young people on a daily basis we run into many technical/equipment malfunctions that oftentimes have no explanation. Reel Works Teen Filmmaking operates on a &#8220;shoe-string&#8221; budget and would not have been as successful in the past year had it not been for Micheil&#8217;s superior troubleshooting skills. Oftentimes, the members of our skeleton staff would attempt to trouble shoot errors while simultaneously running other programs and teaching a class - making for a very hectic and crazy work day. The days we were fortunate enough to work with Micheil were always the most productive. The young people in our program owe a lot of their stress-free success to&nbsp;Micheil.</p>

<p>Goal 1:  To increase participants’ self-sufficient use and application of computer and information&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Goal 2:  To establish a staff and volunteer procedure for troubleshooting / fixing computer&nbsp;workstations.</p>
<p>Goal 3:  To help standardize curriculum design and structure and lesson materials&nbsp;organization.  </p>

<p>As part of her workplan, Ms. Baker completed three self-paced tutorials on our most popular subjects in word processing, spreadsheets, and the Internet. She has also created her own column in our quarterly newsletter called “Tech Corner”, and has completed 5 articles on the most common issues that computer users&nbsp;encounter.</p>
<p>Ms. Baker has established a system of tracking and record-keeping that are important to program evaluation. For example, Ms. Baker has created an attendance log for each course offered by our community technology center, a system of generating class certificates from our database, and new course registration forms that with help make our record-keeping more&nbsp;efficient.</p>
<p>Ms. Baker has also created a popular new program entitled “Afternoons with Angie”, which allows participants with certain questions or issues about their computers or other technology to receive personalized, one-on-one&nbsp;attention.</p>
<p>As a result of our AmeriCorps*VISTA’s contribution to our program and community, we have brought Ms. Baker on board as an official part-time staff person to continue her work at our technology center. We recognize the value that Ms. Baker has put into her service as a VISTA, and look forward to her continued&nbsp;contributions.</p>

Ian Bauer has been working closely with MAFEI/OTX-West staff to meet and exceed workplan objectives as outlined&nbsp;below: </p>
<p>Provide a quality learning experience for both youth and adult volunteers (technical and non-technical) through service learning opportunities at&nbsp;OTX-West.</p>
<p>Provide a relevant, hands-on work experience for&nbsp;youth.</p>

                    <p>Volunteer&nbsp;Training</p>
<p>Ian Bauer worked with staff and the project consultant funded by CTCNET/ATA to assess the current capacity and need for volunteers.  Ian assisted in the development of the volunteer training manual; streamlining the process for coordinating assignments for weekly “Volunteer Days” and “Distribution&nbsp;Days.”</p>
<p>As MAFEI successfully completed the training manual within the projected three-month time period, Ian coordinated the weekly management of both student and adult volunteers who had received computers from OTX-West. To date, approximately 500 student and adults have volunteered at OTX-West including IT students from local vocational programs, high school and middle school students with varying interests in computer&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Ian coordinated interns’ weekly tasks—preparing computer labs for trainings, assembling training materials, staffing distribution days.  Ian is currently developing a training model whereby interns will be able to successfully conduct computer training courses, having become proficient in basic computer software applications and increased their knowledge of computer equipment and basic hardware&nbsp;operations.</p>
<p>Website&nbsp;Development</p>
<p>MAFEI significantly benefited from Ian’s expertise and interest in website design.  Ian increased his responsibilities in this area by successfully upgrading the organization’s website(s) <a href="http://www.mafei.org" title="www.mafei.org">www.mafei.org</a> and <a href="http://www.otxwest.org" title="www.otxwest.org">www.otxwest.org</a>,&nbsp;including:</p>
<p>• Reformatting website graphics,<br />
• Updating and adding to website text for OTX-West offerings, including technical support information and computer class training on-line registration<br />
• Creating links<br />
• Providing easier navigation of&nbsp;website</p>
<p>Learning Without Boundaries Literacy&nbsp;Initiative</p>
<p>Ian contributed significantly to the development of this project.  His role was central and continues to be a vital part of the continuance of this model.  A portion of his responsibilities&nbsp;included:</p>
<p>• Researching software writing&nbsp;programs;</p>
<p>• Conducting assessments and creating computer labs in the classroom of 3rd grade teachers participating in this&nbsp;project.  </p>
<p>• Developing a training manual for parents and students, integrating key components of the writing software program and Internet research.  Students learned how to research topics, find the definition of words and phrases and successfully complete a creative writing assignment (training guide&nbsp;available).</p>
<p>• Conducting computer training classes for third grade students and their&nbsp;families.</p>

                    <p>Among Ian’s talents and strengths are his ability to quickly identify and resolve problems.  As much of this project requires work in diverse communities with limited experience with computer technology,  Ian exhibited tremendous patience and support for these families.  MAFEI equally appreciated his ability to remain flexible in a changing work environment and meet each task with a great enthusiasm and a keen sense of humor.   He was certainly a welcomed addition to our staff.<br />

                    <p>The lab was expanded during the second six month period in order to better serve the local homeless community.  The second site minimized conflict between seniors and homeless computer&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>Goal 1:<br />
6 old computers (Win 95 OS) were replaced with 6 Win XP OS computers.  Curb cuts were added to improve site accessibility.  A variety of input devices were installed to enable alternative input to standard mouse and keyboard.  Two 2-hour classes on basic computing were offered in Spanish, reaching twelve adults.  A variety of user profiles were installed on the computers (low vision, Spanish, etc).  Currently assisting senior with limited vision to determine appropriate computer&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Goal 2:<br />
Two senior volunteers were trained as docents for open access hours.  Training on computer lab resources and basic computing skills were provided to 10 staff members.  Training will continue in an ongoing&nbsp;basis</p>
<p>Goal 3:<br />
One class of young@heart was held and two classes on basic computing in Spanish, in addition to the ongoing computer classes held in the lab.  Open Access hours were implemented; the lab is now available for general use 5 days a&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Goal 4:<br />
Three year funding for the computer lab was secured from the Ventura County Area Agency on&nbsp;Aging.</p>
<p>Additional funding was obtained through the CTCNet C4T program to expand computer lab services to the local homeless&nbsp;community</p>

                    <p>Goal 1. Recruit volunteers and establish an efficient volunteer system and training&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Craig contacted various community organizations to recruit volunteers. He also succeeded in getting The EDGE approved as an off-site location with three new Universities for their Federal Work Study Programs. He submitted information to local organizations’ publications to recruit new volunteers and presented fliers at several organizations’ member&nbsp;meetings.</p>
<p>Craig helped recruit and train four regular volunteer instructors and five regular volunteer class assistants.  Thirty-one classes were taught by volunteers. The EDGE has had in excess of 2700 hours of help from all&nbsp;volunteers.</p>
<p>During Craig’s year we revised, updated, and standardized curricula and handouts for all classes and made all handouts available on The EDGE website.  (<a href="http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/edge/techguides.cfm" title="http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/edge/techguides.cfm">http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/edge/techguides.cfm</a>)  Craig organized the new class schedule and worked with the volunteers on a training schedule and class instructor guidelines. (<a href="http://edge.sgcl.org" title="http://edge.sgcl.org">http://edge.sgcl.org</a>).</p>
<p>Goal 2.  Oversee trained volunteers in the maintenance of the participant and evaluation database, in the collection of follow-up surveys, and in the preparation and support of project courses and&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Craig assisted in modifying The EDGE database and implemented a detailed analysis reporting system to the Director for each class conducted including evaluation of attendance trends in core classes and tutorial topic use.  He developed standard evaluations for each class and methods to better access the patrons’ response to curriculum and specific instructor&nbsp;impact.  </p>
<p>Work-study students were trained to assist with receptionist duties, clerical support, and database data entry for registration, class participation and&nbsp;evaluations.</p>
<p>The EDGE has utilized several employees from the AARP Senior Community Service Employment program.  Craig supervised and trained AARP employees working in various areas such as receptionist duties, clerical support, monitoring tutorial sessions, and data&nbsp;entry.</p>
<p>Craig oversaw the expansion of the self-help tutorial programs to include additional daytime sessions by opening of and securing staffing for a second room dedicated to tutorial sessions during these expanded sessions. 719 tutorial sessions were offered in the tutorial&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>Goal 3. Participate in grant writing and other forms of fundraising, develop media partners, and increase publicity to help ensure the success and sustainability of The&nbsp;EDGE.</p>
<p>Craig submitted articles for newsletters, created flyers for distribution at organizational meetings, and coordinated inclusion of our schedules and tutorial brochures at the Missouri Career&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>He assisted in the development of numerous grant proposals, although no grants were awarded during his year of&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>Craig developed a comprehensive “Corporate” package that was presented to the Executive Director and the Library Board for consideration in the yearly budget process. Craig assisted in a developmental presentation made to the Library’s Board of Directors at a meeting held at The EDGE Community Technology&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>Craig attended the “Business and Technology Expo” held in Springfield in October. It is the largest expo of its kind in southern Missouri.  He was able to network with many local businesses and make initial contact for future development. All contact information received there has been submitted to the Project&nbsp;Director.</p>

                    <p>During the past year with Craig as a VISTA, we increased our attendance at the EDGE facility.  Attendance at all classes and activities for the year was&nbsp;3693.</p>
<p>Craig was responsible for insuring that The EDGE Community Technology Center continued to provide a much needed service to the community during his year of service as a VISTA member. He stepped forward to assist in instruction when needed and took the “Library Express” out for classes and special projects. He built a valuable pool of trained volunteers that will continue to serve.  Craig stepped up in any situation to lend a hand or his expertise to solve a problem or enhance an opportunity. He worked well in supplying needed support and proposals to the Executive office and Board as warranted.  The VISTA program has proven vital to The EDGE’s continued growth and&nbsp;success.</p>

                    <p>CHA and DSSA develop Computer Learning Centers(CLCs) for residents at assigned public housing projects, including those who serve seniors and disabled&nbsp;adults.</p>
<p>Dan Killian replaced Alycia Alexander, as she moved to a full-time position with DSSA at the end of her VISTA year.  Dan came to Sheridan Devon Apartments on the North Side.  Sheridan Devon also was on its way to being self-sustaining, so Dan, like Ted, split his time between two buildings.  Dan worked in Pomeroy Apartments CLC a few blocks away until the Fisher and Pomeroy CLCs were combined this&nbsp;summer.</p>
<p>Dan came with a background in Russian and Uzbek languages, and he began to learn Urdu in the evenings.  Working in buildings with mostly elderly immigrants, his language skills got plenty of practice.  He began to translate curricula, though this proved to be a difficult&nbsp;task.</p>

                    <p>Dan has worked to make connections in the community to expand the CLC beyond the building itself.  He has worked with Loyola University Chicago, specifically Hillel and Loyola Chicago, building on relationships Alycia Alexander started with them last year.  Dan also has built relationships with the Korean American Community Services, CAAELII, The First Bytes Club, and the Bosnian-Herzegovinian American Community Center.  Dan invited guests from this organization to see our CLC, and he toured their centers to see how we could benefit each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>Our best result so far has been the increase in resident volunteers, volunteers who live in the buildings who have gone through computer workshops and who are now sharing what they learned with others.  Many of them had never touched a computer before last year; this year they are&nbsp;teachers!</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, Dan received a job offer in Washington, D.C. that he could not refuse, so he left us at the end of August.  His departure spurred the residents into action because the survival of their CLC depended upon their participation.  Residents who previously had not participated very regularly became dependable volunteers and participate on the Steering&nbsp;Committee.</p>

                    <p>CHA and DSSA develop Computer Learning Centers(CLCs) for residents at assigned public housing projects, including those who serve seniors and disabled&nbsp;adults.</p>
<p>VISTA member Ted Simpao began his year of service at the Lincoln Perry Computer Learning Center.  As that site was on its way to self-sustainability, Ted agreed to help part-time at New Englewood Terrace (NET), where DSSA and CHA were starting a new CLC.  NET will be a new kind of building, with wireless technology throughout.  Ted works very hard, splitting his time working at CLCs in two DSSA buildings on Chicago’s South&nbsp;Side.</p>

                    <p>Many of the regular users at NET are children and young mothers looking for work. Ted has worked with Jonas, Frank and the building staff at NET to create curriculum to suit this population best. They have created résumé workshops and taught residents how to search for jobs on the Internet.  Children who live at NET love to work with educational game software like the Arthur programs, which help them in&nbsp;school.</p>
<p>Ted gives students at Lincoln Perry CLC hands-on demonstrations during his regular lessons.  He demonstrates what he is explaining, and he creates handouts with digital photos of his demonstrations to reiterate the lessons.  This has been an ingenious creation, because he can show more easily than he can explain what he wants them to learn.  We have adopted that idea for use at other CLCs too, especially in places where most of the computer users’ first language is not&nbsp;English.</p>
<p>Ted has brought Welfare to Work program participants into the building offices and into the Computer Learning Center.  Their assistance has been a great boon for Ted and the office staff, plus it allows the participants opportunities to gain new skills and&nbsp;experience.</p>

<p>Goal IV. Rather than a top-down approach where staff guesses what the community wants from their CLC, the VISTA member will meet regularly with a steering committee to determine the needs of the community being&nbsp;served.</p>
<p>Goal V.  Develop a plan for technical support using free community resources. Find volunteers from schools that have community service&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>Goal VI.  Teach Basic Computer Skills to all interested residents and community&nbsp;participants.</p>
<p>Goal VII.  Insure that the CLC is sustainable and&nbsp;replicable.</p>

            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>Goal I.<br />
– The CLCs are welcoming and open at least five days per week.  Most of the time, the CLCs see a steady stream of visitors.<br />
– Volunteer meetings at newest CLCs are not yet regular.<br />
– Time is divided among CLCs, but VISTAs commit at least two days per week per CLC.<br />
– Resident volunteers have organized their own schedule<br />
– We would like to do another Quarterly Volunteer Recognition Event in&nbsp;October.</p>
<p>Goal II.<br />
– Has been successful on the North Side and is growing on the South Side.<br />
– VISTAs continuing Alycia&#8217;s work will pursue this&nbsp;further</p>
<p>Goal III.<br />
- Resident volunteers have increased their participation in teaching each other.  The VISTAs have helped to move self-sustainability forward.<br />
– Local students visit our CLCs.  Children who use the CLC get individualized attention from volunteers and VISTAs.<br />
– At our newest CLCs, the largest group of new users is comprised of school-aged children.<br />
– Resident volunteers have not yet adopted this project as their own; it runs with VISTA&nbsp;guidance.</p>
<p>Goal IV.<br />
– Steering Committees meet regularly and report on their&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>Goal V.<br />
– Our volunteers teach computer programs but we have yet to find reliable volunteer technicians.<br />
– The heads of local service learning organizations have met key residents and building staff.<br />
- Steering Committee is no longer holding regular elections in favor of Asses-Based Community Development, in which community members hold positions based on their pre-existing&nbsp;skills</p>
<p>Goal VI.<br />
– We have worked more on “teaching the teachers” this year, which has given the users themselves more pride in their&nbsp;CLC.</p>
<p>Goal VII.<br />
- This project has been building slowly.  We would like to make it a higher priority in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Dan Killian replaced Alycia Alexander, as she moved to a full-time position with DSSA at the end of her VISTA&nbsp;year.</p>

<p>He has started teaching a new digital photography and young men’s creative writing program, both offered weekly at the center. He will be creating resource manuals for both of these classes which will prove to be very helpful in institutionalizing these&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>And finally, he is now taking on the responsibility of planning our new music recording program. He will be working with a sound recording student from UMASS-Lowell in order to coordinate this&nbsp;project.</p>

                    <p>Approximately two weeks ago, the United Nations celebrated its annual International Day of Peace.  As UTEC was invited to participate in this event (celebrated in Boston), we decided to put together a videotape of how young people define peace in their own local communities.  Dirk was able to work with many young people to get this video accomplished and shown in front of all those in attendance at this event. There is some amazing footage on this tape, particularly of older gang members (ages 22-25) who speak about their own experiences of violence and how they are now working with UTEC’s Peace Team on mediation work with current gang members in Lowell.  Dirk did an excellent job of putting this work together so that it would best reflect the voices of these young&nbsp;people.</p>

                    <p>Dan has been responsible for leading a crew of volunteers, interns and VISTAs working on creating central web-based services for&nbsp;nonprofits.</p>
<p>LTC and the Consortium expect that access to additional technical support and training personnel will result in increased access to computer technology for the community and increased efficiency within organizations through better and easier to-access&nbsp;expertise.</p>
<p>The VISTA member will work with members of the Consortium and the larger Lowell NPO community. The range of activities will vary from organization to organization. In general, VISTas will supervise public access computers, train the community in a wide assortment of computer applications, provide technical support, assist in the setup of new computer labs (including small LANs), and improve and support information systems (i.e., websites, databases, electronic mail, access to the Inernet). We do not expect that every VISTA will have all the necessary skills to accomplish these, but we would like to see the bringing together of a team of individuals that can support and build upon their individual&nbsp;strengths.</p>

                    <p>We&#8217;ve gotten the following new services working in&nbsp;production:</p>
<p>• DNS<br />
• CVS<br />
• SUEXEC<br />
• samba (MS file serving domain controlling on&nbsp;Unix)</p>
<p>These service work in a test environment.<br />
• calendering<br />
• email w/ virus checking<br />
• databases<br />
• SSL<br />
• automatic creation of test systems<br />
• programmatic manipulation of&nbsp;images</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done this additional work outside our charter:<br />
• Trained 40 people in basic UNIX<br />
• Kept the Mercier public access center open and staffed.<br />
• Some other dinky stuff like cleaning up&nbsp;lowellhabitat.org</p>
<p>The SUEXEC project pretty well sums up our experience. It is essential for the future, yet not very incomprehensible to management and time consuming. Further, the available person to lead the project was smart and hardworking but completely&nbsp;inexperienced</p>
<p>Dan spent most of his Fridays and many Saturday&#8217;s this year working with a volunteer to get this project finished. It would have been quicker to do the work himself, but the volunteer benefited greatly from the experience and is eager to contribute more next&nbsp;summer.</p>
