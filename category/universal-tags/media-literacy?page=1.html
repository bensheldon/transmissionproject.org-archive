                    <p>In the fall of 2003, the Playing2Win organization welcomed the assistance of two Vista- Fellows: Mr. Max Benitez, Youth Technology Instructor, and Ms. Kristin Wernicke, Outreach and Development Coordinator. During the course of their tenure, Mr. Benitez and Ms. Wernicke served the center in several component&nbsp;capacities.</p>
<p>As Outreach and Development Coordinator, Ms. Wernicke’s responsibilities included the&nbsp;following: </p>

<p>•Created local resource list for community technology center issues and similar&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>•Worked on building an infrastructure for outreach (i.e., managing and creating databases) that is accessible to youth and other&nbsp;staff.</p>
<p>•Developed and maintained outreach&nbsp;database</p>
<p>•Expanded and intensified program partnerships in New York City and the&nbsp;US</p>
<p>•Developed programs and assisted with planning for future outlook of the community technology&nbsp;center</p>

<p>• The development of volunteer support program for the ongoing support of 10 volunteers and recruitment of 10&nbsp;others.</p>

One example I am reminded of was the special PBS viewing of “Every Mother’s Son,” coordinated by Mr. Bentinez. The event called for local law enforcement agents and community members to come together in support of the idea of social change, justice and a forum for communication and healing. This project used the power of media and the passion of human nature to discuss the realities of police brutality in New York City. This event is also an example of a sustainable solution effort and the ability of change.<br />

<p>First, Gariet brought the OLLIE program and Portland Community Media into the Youth Video Exchange Network (YVXN) as a steering partner. OLLIE’s participation in YVXN has allowed us to share broadcast quality student work with other youth media centers around the country, as well as acquire youth media content to broadcast on our own&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p>In parallel to his work with NYMAP, Gariet also researched and set up a blip.tv site for the OLLIE program. This site allows us to share our videos with others at any time, and in turn allows our visitors to post the videos on their websites and&nbsp;blogs.</p>
<p>Finally, Gariet developed a website for the project using the Drupal content management system. This site provides a comprehensive resource about the program for the communities we serve, and includes a searchable video database. Through his research and work with Drupal and blip.tv for our youth project, Gariet has set a course for the Media Center as a whole. Recently a staff member expressed that Gariet’s ability to explain the benefits and values of these technologies to others led to the media center to develop a digital distribution plan that incorporated the lessons he has learned. Gariet’s work has also had an impact on the larger community, including interesting and attracting a local foundation to provide operational funding for our&nbsp;project.</p>

Gariet is also an excellent teacher.  He is able to engage and inspire his students as they plan and create their video projects. Gariet&#8217;s positive attitude about working with this project and VISTA is enjoyed by those who work with him.  His commitment to helping others and the value of youth media is appreciated.&#8221;<br />

                    <p>In building the capacity of the Grand Rapids Institute for Information Democracy, Tom took on the following&nbsp;responsibilities:</p>
<p>Media Monitoring – this includes daily logging of local news coverage for the studies that GRIID produces yearly on election coverage, race <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gender representation, and any other issue that we may be monitoring. This may also include occasional monitoring of entertainment media; commercials, movies, ads,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Grant Funded Projects – this includes assisting GRIID on grant funded projects that involve working with students and community groups on issues such as tobacco, gender issues and the West Michigan Progressive Directory. This work gives us an opportunity to apply the resources developed in the media monitoring&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Web Site Maintenance and Design – Tom has learned some of the basics of web design and has helped update and create new content for the GRIID website (<a href="http://www.griid.org" title="www.griid.org">www.griid.org</a>).  In particular, he updated the GRIID media directory and the GRIID lending library pages.  Tom also designed and created his AmeriCorps VISTA web page (<a href="http://www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/" title="www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/">www.grcmc.org/americorps/tom/</a>).   </p>
<p>Community Outreach Projects – working on various community-based projects that GRIID is involved in through the Progressive Directory. This involves attending meetings, conducting media trainings, producing media with community groups, and promoting the coalition building through the Progressive Directory. In many ways this is the main outcome goal of GRIID – getting community groups to develop their own media&nbsp;strategies.</p>

            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>Tom played an essential role in completing the Youth Anti-Tobacco Advocacy  Project (<a href="http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/" title="http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/">http://www.griid.org/antitobacco/</a>)  He collected and correlated all the data for this study and created the online report.  He also worked with the student volunteers in creating the study and accompanied them when they presented the study to the Grand Rapids City commission.  Tom also helped in the creation of several grant-funded video productions that GRIID produced, assisting in both the editing and the filming&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Tom does about half of the actual news watching that GRIID undertakes, and is responsible for documenting and tabulating all of the news watching data collected.  He also has taken an active part in writing GRIID studies examining local media coverage on various issues. Over the last six months, Tom played a significant role in creating the content in GRIID’s Election Watch 2004&nbsp;feature.</p>
<p>Tom worked on the grant funded Video Voter Project.  This project tied into GRIID’s election monitoring and education efforts.  Tom’s work monitoring and documenting news coverage were important components of the Video Voter&nbsp;Project.</p>
<p>Tom has been involved in several projects designed to reach out and empower community groups. Tom has been one of the producers of Catalyst Radio, a weekly radio program on the CMC’s radio station WYCE FM.  Catalyst Radio provides news analysis and interviews featuring local community groups and organizations.  Tom writes half of the news analysis pieces as well as being one of the shows on-air voices.  He also is responsible for setting up and conducting the interviews on occasion as well as updating the Catalyst Radio website every&nbsp;week. </p>
<p>Another community outreach effort that Tom has been involved with is GRIID’s work on FCC license renewals procedure education.  This is an effort to build an awareness in the community on the FCC license renewal process which was designed to hold the local TV media accountable to community needs.  As part of this project, Tom has given presentations, created mailing literature, and helped create online&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>GRIID maintains a large collection of documentaries pertaining to issues of media literacy and media and democracy.  Tom has helped organize and promote public showings of these documentary films.  Tom also helped facilitate public discussions following the&nbsp;films.</p>

                    <p>Digital Sisters (DS), Inc. is a 501(C)3 non-profit organization created to promote and provide technology education and enrichment for women and children who are traditioanlly&nbsp;underserved.</p>
<p>If the technology field is any indication of messages sent to women and girls research has shown that women have the least penetration in technology fields. This number decreasing by the inclusion of ethnicity and socio economic factors. Young girls are continuously sent daily messages that technology is “not for&nbsp;them.”</p>
<p>Working through enhance partnerships with community based organizations, corporations, technology centers and local schools, Digital Sisters provides assistance in closing the gender gap in technology that is plaguing single mothers. We have developed and implemented programs that promote needed life skills training and address the impact of the lack of technology skills on families. Our educational philosophy is based on a participatory and interactive learning&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>By providing support through in and out of school activities, community outreach and professional workshops, Digital Sisters empowers women and girls which further strengthens&nbsp;families.</p>
<p>Our programs focus on the participants’ current goals; talents, abilities and interests, then begin to explore opportunities in technology. Sessions stress acquiring skills and knowledge that enhance self-confidence. Activities include hands-on experiences in the computer lab, speakers, and field trips. All programs are designed to provide technology education, increase awareness of gender equity, develop skills, to assist in personal growth, enhance learning, and to build&nbsp;self-esteem.</p>
<p>Digital Sisters&#8217; programs and services will help participants to gain knowledge that can help to combat the alienation, apathy, discrimination and non-participation in technology related environments for those who are&nbsp;disadvantaged.</p>
<p>We provide innovative programs to assist traditionally underserved communities in creative, expressive and cooperative methods of learning utilizing technology empowerment strategies. Digital Sisters provides opportunities to families and individuals that might not otherwise get assistance every single&nbsp;day!</p>
<p>In addition we provide program planning and technology curriculum development for local schools, community technology and learning centers utilizing our technology empowerment&nbsp;strategies.</p>

-Alert non-profit and educational institutions regarding broadcast application opportunities. Travel and give presentations for starting new radio facilities.<br />
-Encourage public participation in radio broadcasting, especially to underrepresented, minorities, youth, student, disabled, and local viewpoints.<br />
-Promote a diversity of viewpoints on the public airwaves through the airing of grassroots-produced public affairs programming.<br />
-Promote music education and independent artists on non-commercial radio.<br />
-Provide resources and consultation, and participate in creating new stations, applying for radio channels, and providing information on&nbsp;governance.</p>
<p>CF is directly involved in grantwriting for radio facilities, networking proposed facilities to enable content-sharing among grassroots radio outlets, and building its own&nbsp;facility.</p>
<p>CF directly aids other community nonprofits to in turn help the citizens of the communities they represent&nbsp;by:</p>
<p>-Providing them cost-free engineering and legal services to start new radio stations to groups that cannot afford them (CF has provided $61,000 in free professional services in ‘09-10 in several states including IL, KS, VA, NY, NC, PA, <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;OR)</p>
<p>-Having a media literacy campaign directed towards underrepresented factions, instigating local broadcast&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>-Providing grantwriting services (CF wrote PTFP grants totaling $345,000 in 2010, free of cost, for nonprofits that represent lower socioeconomically diverse people to help them gain media access in the California counties of San Diego, Tulare, and San&nbsp;Joaquin).</p>
<p>CF is working with over a dozen radio applicants to make public access radio stations where community members can create their own public affairs shows to empower local participation in the realm of promoting social, economic, and environmental&nbsp;justice.</p>
