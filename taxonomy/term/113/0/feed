 <title>Alternate ROOTS - Rebirth of a Nation: Using art to navigate the intersection of oppressions</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2009/08/alternate-roots-rebirth-of-a-nation-using-art-to-navigate-the-intersection-of-oppress</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s annual meeting theme will be &amp;#8220;Re-birth of a Nation: Using art to navigate the intersection of oppressions.&amp;#8221; As a phoenix rising from the ashes, America is entering a time of new opportunities for growth, change, and awareness, a re-birthing. These same opportunities parallel Alternate &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ROOTS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; strategic planning year, as we evaluate and build a stronger foundation for Alternate &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ROOTS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; future.  With change looming ahead we cannot forget our purpose, and understand that we have miles to travel in the work to end all forms of oppression. How can &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ROOTS&lt;/span&gt; re-define its use of art to navigate that intersection? What will it take to activate the collective consciousness of the&amp;nbsp;future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s theme supports the idea that sustainable communities are needed in order to truly work towards ending oppression, and the idea that sustainability comes in many forms whether environmentally, psychologically, or spiritually &amp;#8220;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&amp;#8221; in every sense of the expression. We have the opportunity to reduce our consumption environmentally as well as reduce the ignorance feeding oppression. We have the opportunity to reuse materials and goods as well as reuse the knowledge of our ancestors to strengthen the connection between art and the movement. We can recycle these ideas into constructive images and&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/p&gt;
