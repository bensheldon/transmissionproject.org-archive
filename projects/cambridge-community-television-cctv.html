We have countless blog posts, videos, photos and other pieces of issue-oriented media published on our website, and they have been seen by thousands of visitors in the course of the year. Julie&#8217;s execution of the Neighbormedia program also greatly successful in bringing our communities closer to each other. We saw many scenarios in which one citizen journalist published material about a community issue which then led to a high level of readership, discussion and participation around that particular issue. Bringing local producers together with their local audience is a massive tool for building&nbsp;community.</p>

      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>To quickly review Jennifer’s first quarter initiatives, her project included research into the demographic makeup of the city of Cambridge, preparing a significant report on ethnic and language identity by zip code of our community, and identifying organizations in our community to build relationships with to better serve our city.  Jennifer’s second quarter worked to increasing member production rates and values by fostering and mentoring two member production groups; one group for the support of active producers working on individual productions, and the next a group focused on cooperatively producing a current affairs&nbsp;program. </p>
<p>Jennifer has also been responsible for a couple of community television events.  These are events that, without CCTV and the hard work of our interns, would not have made the nightly&nbsp;news. </p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, a new initiative was born and Jennifer became the supervisor for our Summer Media Institute, a youth media program operated here at CCTV in collaboration with the Mayor’s Summer Youth Employment Program.  The Mayor’s office runs a program each summer placing teenagers for six weeks in various host sites with the intent to provide structure, job training, and income for youth in the city of&nbsp;Cambridge. </p>
<p>The twelve teenagers placed with CCTV undergo a rigorous media training program including digital camera and editing techniques, documentary and fiction production, software and other hard skills through project-based workshops and weekly screenings. This program empowers our twelve Cambridge youth each year with the ability to produce media that more accurately reflects their lives and experiences in our city.  This program is several years old and graduates continue to return for our services and facilities in their independent media&nbsp;work.</p>

has had with the VISTA program and it is clearly because of Jennifer’s strength of<br />
character and investment in her work.  She far exceeded our expectations and through her<br />
year long service she greatly improved the services CCTV has to offer our community.<br />
In fact, her excellent work was the reason we have offered her a full time position here at<br />

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
