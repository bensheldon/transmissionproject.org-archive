                    <p>Heads on Fire partners with social change agencies and community technology companies to provide technology access and education, primarily for youth, in underserved areas. Most of the work takes place after school and in the summer, at sites around the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>Activities are divided into three&nbsp;areas:</p>
<p>The [i]-Team provides digital literacy&nbsp;instruction.</p>
<p>ECHOES magazine helps youth use digital technology to document stories of community interest.<br />
This nationally distributed CD-ROM magazine contains multimedia journalism pieces as well as entertainment sections such as music and game reviews.<br />
Working in close partnership with Christina Glavas, of Minds Wide Open, ECHOES provides training in journalism, digital photography, video editing, audio production, and interactive game design.<br />
Participants work on Saturdays to develop their design skills and take part in a global education curriculum project. Themes such as imagery, oral histories, languages, community orientation, cultural heritage, and other international issues are used as a context for the work.<br />
The work includes traveling to different sites to conduct interviews, as well as production and design time spent in the lab.<br />
The ECHOES training is free and open to youth in San Diego between the ages of 14–18. There is an application process, and participants must be willing to make a ten-month&nbsp;commitment.</p>
<p>The Sunscreens series features the digital work of youth in a two-month gallery exhibit, based on an annual theme.<br />
Each show includes a display of pieces on gallery walls, programs of audio-visual recordings, and interactive kiosks display works created for the computer and the web.<br />
The theme for 2004 was artistic statements made either by or about young Californians who are a part of communities in distress. These included communities affected by crime, poverty, gangs, racism, health crises, refugee status, or social&nbsp;injustice.</p>

                    <p>To thrive in today&#8217;s world, everyone deserves the opportunity to take advantage of the accessibility that technology affords us. Unfortunately, for low-income families and individuals with disabilities, these opportunities and often difficult to come&nbsp;by.</p>
<p>Handy Capable Network (HCN) assists these individuals, as well as local nonprofit organizations, in accessing technology that had previously been beyond their reach. HCN trains adults with disabilities in the skills necessary to use and repair computers. We strive to create an environment where disabled individuals can learn valuable computer skills, gain self-esteem, and encourage personal growth and independence. For low-income families who do not have access to computer technology at home, we provide them with free or low-cost refurbished computers, and the requisite educational information to fully utilize these exciting&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>In order for HandyCapable to carry out its mission of helping socioeconomically challenged or developmentally disabled individuals to cross the digital divide, we depend on donations of used computers from individuals and businesses in the community. To learn how you can help, please click&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>As a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher, HCN installs Microsoft Windows on all of our refurbished computers. Additionally, we format all donated computers to the security standards used by the US Dept. of&nbsp;Defense.</p>

                    <p>We see a future where the children of Friendship House graduate from high school, from technical school, from college, with a meaningful education and a full compliment of life skills. We see a future where our kids are getting and keeping good paying jobs with benefits and the potential for advancement. We see the people who graduate from our program owning homes, buying goods and services, starting businesses, and paying taxes. We see them being actively involved in civic and social affairs and working collectively to improve and strengthen our community and the community of Billings at large. This is what breaking the cycle of poverty looks like and that&#8217;s what we are&nbsp;doing. </p>
<p>The &#8220;digital divide&#8221; is very real in our neighborhood. In June 2004 we made a commitment to significantly strengthen the academic and technological components of our youth development program. We have invested more than $150,000 in this effort to date. Currently, only children and teens enrolled in our programs have access to our computers and related technologies. So we are constructing an addition to the building that will become a Community Technology Center (CTC) and allow us to share these resources with the entire community. When people lack access to the technology that is defining our economy and its job market and they lack the skills to use this technology, they find themselves at a distinct disadvantage. Our expanded CTC will provide education and skill building opportunities to community members of all ages and abilities in an environment supportive of&nbsp;learning.</p>

There is also a small conference room, additional tutoring space and a reception&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>Basic computer software and Internet training for adults is the main emphasis at The EDGE.  Self-paced tutorials are available for more advanced software training.  Subject specific Internet classes and Workforce related courses are also&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>All sessions are free and open to the public. A printed schedule of all classes is available at any Springfield Greene County Library. Our schedule is also available&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>Mission Statement<br />
The mission of The EDGE Community Technology Center is to help close the digital divide by providing a dynamic, safe and inviting environment where members of the community can come to access the newest technology and/or to acquire the training and support needed to help them use information and the power of technology to improve their&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>The EDGE fulfills the Library&#8217;s mission to provide opportunities for lifelong learning, self-improvement and self-expression and to meet the educational, informational and recreation needs of the&nbsp;community.</p>

                    <p>Digital Sisters (DS), Inc. is a 501(C)3 non-profit organization created to promote and provide technology education and enrichment for women and children who are traditioanlly&nbsp;underserved.</p>
<p>If the technology field is any indication of messages sent to women and girls research has shown that women have the least penetration in technology fields. This number decreasing by the inclusion of ethnicity and socio economic factors. Young girls are continuously sent daily messages that technology is “not for&nbsp;them.”</p>
<p>Working through enhance partnerships with community based organizations, corporations, technology centers and local schools, Digital Sisters provides assistance in closing the gender gap in technology that is plaguing single mothers. We have developed and implemented programs that promote needed life skills training and address the impact of the lack of technology skills on families. Our educational philosophy is based on a participatory and interactive learning&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>By providing support through in and out of school activities, community outreach and professional workshops, Digital Sisters empowers women and girls which further strengthens&nbsp;families.</p>
<p>Our programs focus on the participants’ current goals; talents, abilities and interests, then begin to explore opportunities in technology. Sessions stress acquiring skills and knowledge that enhance self-confidence. Activities include hands-on experiences in the computer lab, speakers, and field trips. All programs are designed to provide technology education, increase awareness of gender equity, develop skills, to assist in personal growth, enhance learning, and to build&nbsp;self-esteem.</p>
<p>Digital Sisters&#8217; programs and services will help participants to gain knowledge that can help to combat the alienation, apathy, discrimination and non-participation in technology related environments for those who are&nbsp;disadvantaged.</p>
<p>We provide innovative programs to assist traditionally underserved communities in creative, expressive and cooperative methods of learning utilizing technology empowerment strategies. Digital Sisters provides opportunities to families and individuals that might not otherwise get assistance every single&nbsp;day!</p>
<p>In addition we provide program planning and technology curriculum development for local schools, community technology and learning centers utilizing our technology empowerment&nbsp;strategies.</p>

                    <p>To create an environment where Southwest Michigan residents view differences among themselves as strengths that open opportunities for everyone to grow and participate fully, rather than seeing differences as threats or&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>The Council for World-Class Communities is nonprofit volunteer organization that was formed in January 2001. It seeks to break down barriers to diversity-with-inclusion, as well as barriers to economic prosperity for Southwest Michigan residents. The Council uses diversity-with-inclusion education and awareness as the foundation for all of its projects and programs. The CWCCâ s major programs include the Bridges to Digital Excellence (BDE) project, Community-Wide Diversity Training, and Calling All Colors. The BDE project provides refurbished computers and software to technology-disadvantaged families in Southwest Michigan. Community-Wide Diversity Training is open to any member of our communities and trains residents to deliver a comprehensive eight-module diversity-with-inclusion curriculum within their organization. The Calling All Colors project is designed to provide an opportunity for students to learn about racial intolerance and develop action plans for increasing appreciation for racial diversity in their school communities. The CWCC programs and projects are designed to serve all of the residents of Southwest Michigan; however, the CWCCâ s primary constituency is the greater Twin Cities area, which includes Benton Harbor, Benton Township, Lincoln Township, Royalton Township, St. Joseph, St. Joseph Township and Stevensville. Additionally, many CWCC programs affect residents from across Berrien County and in parts of neighboring Van Buren&nbsp;County.</p>

                    <p>Computers4Kids is a non-profit after-school technology mentoring program for disadvantaged youth. We strive to improve low income youth&#8217;s computer and learning skills through caring mentorship, structured training, a vibrant learning environment, and access to a computer at home. The program uses computers as a catalyst for youth to challenge themselves, become engaged in their own learning, and realize greater possibilities academically, professionally, and for their&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Charlottesville and Albemarle students in grades 7 through 12, who qualify for the federal lunch program, are eligible to join our program. While much of our focus is on our mentoring program, Computers4Kids also emphasizes after-school independent learning as well. Students using the lab when not meeting with their mentor enjoy workshops, structured activities, and other projects so that they may continue to learn new skills. All students in the program are eligible to earn a free home computer system and year of free internet access. Once a year we have a formal celebration to honor Computers4Kids&nbsp;graduates.</p>
<p>In April 2009 Computers4Kids launched Teen Tech , a program created specifically for graduates of our nine-month mentoring program. Graduates have the opportunity to further their technology skills, receive college and career guidance, and be a part of the Teen Tech&nbsp;community.</p>

                    <p>Most jobs now require some degree of proficiency in computer skills. A significant percentage of low-income adults do not have these skills that are prerequisites for gaining more meaningful employment, and Northern Virginia&#8217;s businesses need more skilled workers. Computer C.O.R.E.&#8217;s training program addresses these needs by providing training in computer skills, personal development, and job search&nbsp;strategies. </p>
<p>CORE&#8217;s Mission is to help low-income adults acquire the technological and life skills they need to pursue their career&nbsp;aspirations.</p>
<p>CORE&#8217;s Vision is a world where all people shall have the skills and confidence to pursue their dreams, reach their full potential, and make meaningful contributions to their&nbsp;communities.</p>
