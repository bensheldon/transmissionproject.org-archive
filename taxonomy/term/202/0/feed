 <title>Broadband according to the FCC?</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/1/broadband-according-to-the-fcc</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://transmissionproject.org/sites/transmissionproject.org/files/fcc-broadband-def.png&quot; alt=&quot;The FCC&#039;s definition of Broadband&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we attended the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s workshop last week, one of the handouts was the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s consumer publication &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/broadbandbrochure.html&quot;&gt;Broadband Brochure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. While informative, the publication does not break any new ground definitely: broadband is defined as &amp;#8220;faster than dial-up service and it doesn’t tie up your telephone line like dial-up often does&amp;#8221;; nor&amp;nbsp;metaphorically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To better understand the differences between dial-up and broadband, it might help to envision the Internet as a pipeline for information. If the pipeline is narrow, less information can fit. Bigger pipes allow for increased and more complex information to flow back and forth – bringing content and information to you at faster speeds. Dial-up uses narrow pipes. Broadband uses increasingly fatter pipes that allow much more complex information to flow at faster speeds, including complex graphics and&amp;nbsp;videos.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glossary of terms in the back is of equivalent&amp;nbsp;depth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
bandwidth - The capacity of your broadband connection to send and receive the data. The higher the bandwidth, the faster the transmission of data. Bandwidth is measured in bits per&amp;nbsp;second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blog - An online, chronicle journal; short for&amp;nbsp;“weblog.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;download - To transfer a file or files from one computer to another, for example, from a server to your desktop computer. Download is the opposite of&amp;nbsp;upload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e-mail - Messages sent via the Internet. E-mail can be everything from simple messages or can contain pictures, video - even&amp;nbsp;voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;encrypted - Encrypted data is data that has been converted so it cannot be easily understood by unauthorized&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instant message (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt;) - A way of communicating with another Internet user by way of simple text-based chat&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address - A numeric code number assigned to the computers in a network. A static &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address is permanent. A dynamic address always changes every time you connect to the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Service Provider (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;) - A company that provides its customers access to the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modem - The device that connects your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; to the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;social networking - An online community of people who are socializing with each other via a particular&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) - A technology that allows you to make and receive calls over the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;webcam - A simple video camera that connects to your computer and enables you to send live and recorded video as well as still pictures via the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WiFi - Wireless broadband. Available in many public&amp;nbsp;locations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the booklet touts the benefits of broadband, but near the end waffles a bit: the section entitled &amp;#8220;How can I get it&amp;#8221; includes both dial-up and broadband; the &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8221; apparently referring to the Internet in general. Fortunately they do mention libraries, public computing centers and &amp;#8220;retailers&amp;#8221;,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to pick on the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;, but if these issues require broad and substantial dialogue (as we believe they do), then the dialogue should be framed with meaningful and informative&amp;nbsp;descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Different frames of media justice</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/1/different-frames-of-media-justice</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many wonderful threads to pull from &lt;a h ref=&quot;http://www.fex.org/assets/418_hjmjflocalorganizers2.pdf&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Media Justice Through the Eyes of Local Organizers&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, a field report from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fex.org/mjf/&quot;&gt;Funding Exchange Media Justice Fund&lt;/a&gt; that came out in September, 2009. In addition to analyzing the different frames groups may approach media and communications justice from, they also make clear that there can be no one-size-fits-all&amp;nbsp;approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Comparing her work in the Bay Area to her current work in Louisiana, Xochitl Bervara of Families and Friends of Louisiana&amp;#8217;s Incarcerated Children (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FFLIC&lt;/span&gt;) was surprised to find that public access &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and community radio are uniquely important for the families she works with in Louisiana because literacy rates are so low there. Public Access &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; in Louisiana is an important source of civic information. Community radio helps get people out to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FFLIC&lt;/span&gt; meetings. For community outreach, computers are unusual. Even phone-based outreach can be a challenge. Low-income people tend to rely on pay- as-you-go cell phones and numbers change&amp;nbsp;frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the Bay Area where local organizers told us “access is not an issue” staying in touch with some people can be extremely challenging. To stay in touch with transgender people of color who get caught up in the criminal justice system, Alexander Lee of the Transgender, Gender Variant and Intersex Justice Project often has to resort to tracking them down in person. He believes literacy, digital literacy and cultural discomfort all contribute to low internet usage among those he works with. As pay phones have disappeared, Alex says it’s actually harder than it used to be to stay in touch with this vulnerable population, especially those who have been recently released from jail or&amp;nbsp;prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of these challenges, most local organizers we spoke with are relying on internet-based communication tools to keep in touch with their constituencies including social networking, web 2.0 media, and collaborative hubs. Local organizers tend to be circumspect about using internet for their work. They tend to see it as one means of keeping in touch among many and not as a replacement for meetings, phone calls, and other forms of media.	They note that differences in demographics such as age and education still make a difference in people’s available and preferred means of keeping in touch. Most organizers said they needed to use multiple methods to keep in touch with the communities they serve. According to Ricardo Valadez of Jobs with Justice, the communications strategy that works with one demographic won’t work with another, “Most marketing and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; work relies on ‘hyper-targeting’ but that doesn’t work and isn’t desirable or feasible when your goal is to help people see their struggle in other people’s&amp;nbsp;struggles.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
