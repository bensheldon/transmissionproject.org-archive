                    <p>BCFI was established in 1986 to provide programs and services aimed at strengthening children and families.  Today, we serve children and families of all ethnic groups, as we are located in one of the most diverse communities in the&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>The mission of BCFI reflects the commitment necessary in the Lansing area to address the critical need for a broad range of activities and services essential to raising and meeting the aspirations of many children and families.  Our proven record and major focus on academic tutorial, enrichment and enhancement for children and adults, computer technology training, financial literacy, community unity and cultural activities set us apart from other&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>BCFI has a long history of providing services to youth and young adults in our community.  For more than 23 years we have operated a variety of programs that have offered services in the areas of tutoring and academic achievement; summer employment opportunities; job shadowing; paid/unpaid work experiences; leadership development through community service activity; positive social behavior; and mentoring.  We have a full on-site computer lab, a cadre of loyal dedicated volunteers, a strong network of public and private entities, and a deep-rooted commitment to our community which makes us a strong provider of&nbsp;services.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>The Closing the Digital Gap (CTDG) program was fortunate to train nearly 500 Lansing area residents, approximately 240 in the Michigan Works Internet job search program, 139 in our core computer give-a-way program, 72 in the Computer Literacy program, and 45 in the our Web Page Creation class. Staff and volunteers exceeded their six month training goal from February to August of 2004; nearly every staff received over 25 hours of additional training — our partners Michigan State University and New Horizons Computer Learning Centers were responsible for the majority of&nbsp;training.  </p>
<p>Amy Radigan was very instrumental in the marketing, recruitment, scheduling, processing and teaching of All Closing the Digital Gap programs, especially those programs held in the Magic Johnson Lab.  Amy did the initial intake of all perspective participants including following-up on messages about programs, creating and disseminating program information, and assisting in the instruction of various CTDG&nbsp;classes.</p>
<p>Amy assisted in expanding one of CTDG’s programs pertaining to bridging the Digital Divide for the developmentally disabled (dd), using her contacts from a previous job to disseminate information to other organizations that work with the developmentally disabled.  Through her efforts, CTDG not only trained more dds but offered on the job training to 3 dds and hired another&nbsp;dd.</p>

<p>Objective 2: All Vistas Have had over 10 days of&nbsp;training.</p>
<p>Objective 3: Victoria has provided support services to all 516&nbsp;graduates</p>
<p>Objective 4: Victoria has scheduled Workshops for 414 graduates since she started. She has assisted in the recruitment of 24 volunteers. Victoria is part of the new and old equipment teams. These teams are responsible for the dispensing and acquiring of all computers and component parts.Victoria has assisted in the scheduling of 24&nbsp;volunteers,</p>
<p>Objective 5: We have received funding from foundations for over $90,000. We fell short of our objective to raise $8,000 from faith based organizations and $14,000 in individual donations. We received $7,100 from faith based organizations and $10,000 from individuals. We have received a continuation from the City of Lansing Economic Development Initiative and increased the funding to&nbsp;$40,000.</p>
<p>One of the major problems our program has encountered in the past is the overwhelming popularity our program; we have reduced our waiting list to the point that that a new applicant is able to attend class in 6-8 months. We have a new internet service provider ACD.NET who has generously agreed to provide all of the Closing the Digital Gap’s graduates with free 1 year internet service.  We have come along way in a short period of time, but we still have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p>

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

“By concentrating on curriculum and training, Gariet made sure that the website would stay useful to the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program beyond just his year with&nbsp;us. </p>
<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
