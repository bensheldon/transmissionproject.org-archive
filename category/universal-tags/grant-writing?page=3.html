                    <p>Aaron has worked on a variety of fundraising, PR, and development projects. His main projects include: setting up a database to better organize our individual donor stewardship and cultivation campaign, working with corporate sponsors to secure technology equipment for UTEC&#8217;s new youth center, and instituting a new giving program for local&nbsp;corporations.</p>

                    <p>Aaron has done a significant amount of work with these projects, securing donations of large scale pieces of equipment for UTEC as well as really streamlining the research, cataloging, and time line of our donor campaigns using online research tools and creating a database. He has also done some PR work designing materials for our corporate giving campaign. Additional projects include writing two grants and securing funding for our sports and recreation program. And updating and refining our donor mailing list which we use to send out newsletters, annual appeals, and other updates. He also worked to coordinate and publicize one fundraising event: an organ concert which drew over 60 people to the center, raised $500 and generated an enormous amount of local publicity for UTEC. We&#8217;ve had some challenges in focusing these projects in a way that priorities are clear so that deadlines will be met, as there is such a large number of projects to be covered in terms of the fund raising needs of the youth center. Aaron has done a great job of learning more organizational methods, and is putting them into practice in new ways that are really helping his&nbsp;work.</p>

                    <p>Aaron&#8217;s behind-the-scenes service to UTEC and the Lowell community has impacted young people&#8217;s lives and their access to resources, particularly technology in so many ways. Recently, Aaron contacted our donors and worked through their networks to secure donations and discounts of computer hardware. His work secured a deep discount of new model PCs and these will be purchased in the next few months. His hard work has ensured new technology for free teen use in our tech center. These young people typically do not have computers or internet access at home, so the addition of newer, faster computers to the tech center will ensure many more young people get access to the Internet each day for help with research, homework, job seeking and&nbsp;communication.</p>

                    <p>Goal 1. Recruit volunteers and establish an efficient volunteer system and training&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Craig contacted various community organizations to recruit volunteers. He also succeeded in getting The EDGE approved as an off-site location with three new Universities for their Federal Work Study Programs. He submitted information to local organizations’ publications to recruit new volunteers and presented fliers at several organizations’ member&nbsp;meetings.</p>
<p>Craig helped recruit and train four regular volunteer instructors and five regular volunteer class assistants.  Thirty-one classes were taught by volunteers. The EDGE has had in excess of 2700 hours of help from all&nbsp;volunteers.</p>
<p>During Craig’s year we revised, updated, and standardized curricula and handouts for all classes and made all handouts available on The EDGE website.  (<a href="http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/edge/techguides.cfm" title="http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/edge/techguides.cfm">http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/edge/techguides.cfm</a>)  Craig organized the new class schedule and worked with the volunteers on a training schedule and class instructor guidelines. (<a href="http://edge.sgcl.org" title="http://edge.sgcl.org">http://edge.sgcl.org</a>).</p>
<p>Goal 2.  Oversee trained volunteers in the maintenance of the participant and evaluation database, in the collection of follow-up surveys, and in the preparation and support of project courses and&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Craig assisted in modifying The EDGE database and implemented a detailed analysis reporting system to the Director for each class conducted including evaluation of attendance trends in core classes and tutorial topic use.  He developed standard evaluations for each class and methods to better access the patrons’ response to curriculum and specific instructor&nbsp;impact.  </p>
<p>Work-study students were trained to assist with receptionist duties, clerical support, and database data entry for registration, class participation and&nbsp;evaluations.</p>
<p>The EDGE has utilized several employees from the AARP Senior Community Service Employment program.  Craig supervised and trained AARP employees working in various areas such as receptionist duties, clerical support, monitoring tutorial sessions, and data&nbsp;entry.</p>
<p>Craig oversaw the expansion of the self-help tutorial programs to include additional daytime sessions by opening of and securing staffing for a second room dedicated to tutorial sessions during these expanded sessions. 719 tutorial sessions were offered in the tutorial&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>Goal 3. Participate in grant writing and other forms of fundraising, develop media partners, and increase publicity to help ensure the success and sustainability of The&nbsp;EDGE.</p>
<p>Craig submitted articles for newsletters, created flyers for distribution at organizational meetings, and coordinated inclusion of our schedules and tutorial brochures at the Missouri Career&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>He assisted in the development of numerous grant proposals, although no grants were awarded during his year of&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>Craig developed a comprehensive “Corporate” package that was presented to the Executive Director and the Library Board for consideration in the yearly budget process. Craig assisted in a developmental presentation made to the Library’s Board of Directors at a meeting held at The EDGE Community Technology&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p>Craig attended the “Business and Technology Expo” held in Springfield in October. It is the largest expo of its kind in southern Missouri.  He was able to network with many local businesses and make initial contact for future development. All contact information received there has been submitted to the Project&nbsp;Director.</p>

                    <p>During the past year with Craig as a VISTA, we increased our attendance at the EDGE facility.  Attendance at all classes and activities for the year was&nbsp;3693.</p>
<p>Craig was responsible for insuring that The EDGE Community Technology Center continued to provide a much needed service to the community during his year of service as a VISTA member. He stepped forward to assist in instruction when needed and took the “Library Express” out for classes and special projects. He built a valuable pool of trained volunteers that will continue to serve.  Craig stepped up in any situation to lend a hand or his expertise to solve a problem or enhance an opportunity. He worked well in supplying needed support and proposals to the Executive office and Board as warranted.  The VISTA program has proven vital to The EDGE’s continued growth and&nbsp;success.</p>

<p>Due to circumstances outside of Antonio’s control  (staff reduction at San Martin), Antonio had no supervision. It was decided that Antonio would try to work in the computer center at the new MAAC charter school. It turned out to be a good match. We feel that both Antonio and the Charter School have benefited from this new&nbsp;arrangement.</p>

                    <p>Our VISTA volunteer, Elizabeth Chesler, has undertaken the role of Workforce Development Coordinator.  In that capacity Elizabeth has been invaluable in identifying resources, providing planning and coordination for IT related projects, and helping with capacity building by researching and applying for grants and in-kind assistance.  One of the main and most important projects Elizabeth is working on is a Microsoft data management project for which she is serving as an in-house and affiliate liaison and testing a prototype.  Another project in which Ms. Chesler has become indispensable is the school bookstore, which under her leadership recently had its grand opening.  The bookstore, which sells textbooks, dictionaries, and other study related products as well as school support items such as t-shirts and hats, is a much-needed resource which also generates unrestricted income. This project is helping to support the Workforce Development programs, including the IT&nbsp;programs.</p>

                    <p>Elizabeth’s contribution to the Carlos Rosario School in coordinating the Microsoft data software is a prime example of a VISTA volunteer getting things done in the community. The software will make a great impact on the efficiency of the school and will help it to better serve thousands of students.  The finished product will also be utilized by countless organizations which serve communities all over the United&nbsp;States. </p>
<p>Another example is opening the student bookstore.  In her role managing the bookstore, Elizabeth interacts daily with many of the hundreds of students who attend the school. She has been the driving force behind a resource which allows students to quickly and easily access supplies essential to their learning.  Prior to the opening of the in-house bookstore, students were only able to purchase textbooks during limited on-site visits from the supplier, or had to make a special trip to an off-site store.  Many students have limited transportation options, and the availability of on-site resources makes a huge impact in the school community.  The bookstore, which held its grand opening last week, has already generated approximately $1500 in net proceeds for the&nbsp;school.</p>

                    <p>HOLA’s AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, Ashley Cross, has been an amazing addition to Heart of Los Angeles Youth (HOLA). You need only visit our new and improved website to see the many ways that she has made a tremendous impact upon the organization.  At <a href="http://www.heartofla.org" title="www.heartofla.org">www.heartofla.org</a> you will see updated stories and press releases which Ashley designed and published.  She also designed and formatted a link for point of donation opportunities, as well as a merchandizing page featuring HOLA cards designed by our youth.  HOLA has received close to $3,000 in donations through our website to date, which funds can be directly attributed to Ashley’s efforts.  We also received a $50,000 grant that came through our new and improved site. Please take a look at the home page and the articles included on the site, which Ashley was responsible for designing and formatting.  Ashley was able to recreate on our web site the entire article about HOLA, including photographs, which was published in “La Opinion”.  She was responsible for creating the Special Events page and many of the stories and pictures throughout the site.  At the same time, we have been able to hard copies of the PDF articles from the web site to form an integral part of HOLA’s press packet.  Ashley’s contribution to the HOLA website is only one very critical part of how she&#8217;s expanded the capacity for our&nbsp;organization.  </p>
<p>Ashley succeeded in refurbishing the 30 laptops ahead of schedule, but the organization encountered some unforeseen obstacles in procuring battery packs, a wireless router, wireless cards, and most importantly, a space to accommodate the Mobile Lab Project.  Thanks to Ashley’s research, these were obtained during the last quarter of her term. While these challenges were being addressed, we added the new goal of increasing the capacity of HOLA’s development office through the overall improvement of the website, which Ashley undertook with great efficiency and&nbsp;success. </p>
<p>The Mobile Lab Project is now slated to be unveiled in March or April of 2006, a successful culmination of Ashley’s research and development efforts.  Batteries, cards and a router have been obtained, and funds have been secured for the build-out of the new Teen&nbsp;Center.</p>

                    <p>Ashley’s ability to accomplish tasks quickly has greatly enhanced HOLA’s public image, giving a much-needed dynamic quality to the website, much to the organization’s benefit.  Because she finished the Mobile Laptop Project in such a timely manner, HOLA was able to gain additional financial support from national companies towards launching a new Teen Center.  Ashley successfully adapted to the new goals as they evolved during the year, and she was able to complete the tasks set out for her before the end of her contract.  Fortunately for Heart of Los Angeles Youth, Ashley’s next post will be as a full-time staff member.  She joined HOLA’s staff as the Bridges After School Manager and Volunteer Coordinator on September 19,&nbsp;2005.</p>

                    <p>Mike has updated CTOC’s current database and is 70% complete with updating the information on CTOC members of organizations. Our VISTA has gained considerable knowledge of the organizations listed in our membership database and will be able to easily consolidate both databases into one main database. With the consolidation of both databases that total over six hundred (600) CTC’s, CTOC will be able to significantly improve our outreach&nbsp;efforts. </p>
<p>As part of the updating procedures we have contacted each organization to establish a contact person for each non-profit organization that provides technology services. Mike has completed updating 70% of the organizations’ contact information and has been able to find a designated person for each organization and updating their email addresses. His efforts to gain the correct contact information for these organizations  has provided CTOC with a face and voice in the community and increased our visibility with CTCs in Los Angeles. With the increased visibility in the CTC community we have been able to increase the attendance of CTOC members and Non-Member to event workshops by at least&nbsp;30%.</p>
<p>Mike has designed and developed promotional materials for at least three of CTOC’s events over the past three&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Mike reviewed materials on evaluation methods and was instrumental in assisting CTOC’s staff in the development of a survey instrument that we are using to collect data on the CTCs in the Los Angeles region. Mike completed 24 CTC site visits in Los Angeles. Not only have these site visits given us a chance to collect information on the local CTC, it has given him an opportunity to get first hand knowledge of the types of programs that are offered by the various CTCs around Los Angeles. We have collected data on 61 CTCs in the Los Angeles region including San Bernardino County. Over the past six (6) months he has enter the 60% of the data that will be used of evaluation. Over the next six (6) months he will assist the staff with data&nbsp;evaluation. </p>
<p>Mike has provided us with information on funding resources that are available via the CTCnet listserv. He has participated and given input in our discussions on being a CTCnet chapter affiliate. He will be doing some research and grant writing for demonstration project that we will&nbsp;undertake.</p>
