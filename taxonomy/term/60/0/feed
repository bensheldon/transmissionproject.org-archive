 <title>Gov 2.0 Summit</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/09/gov-20-summit</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gov 2.0 Summit brings together innovators from government and the private sector to highlight technology and ideas that can be applied to the nation’s great challenges. In areas as diverse as education, health care, energy, jobs, and financial reform, there are unique opportunities to rethink how government agencies perform their mission and serve our citizens. Social media, cloud computing, web, and mobile technologies—all provide new capabilities that government agencies are beginning to harness to achieve demonstrably better results at lower&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happening September 7-8 at the Grand Hyatt Washington, Gov 2.0 Summit brings the latest in technology thinking and capabilities to Washington, with fresh voices, cutting edge demos, and thought-provoking conversations. We explore the implications of the latest technology for policy, for the design of government programs, and for the implementation of government technology&amp;nbsp;strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear from industry giants like Cisco, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, Microsoft, and Google, as well as innovative startups like Palantir, drop.io, Slideshare, and more. You’ll also hear from leading government technology implementers and policymakers about their successes, the obstacles they face, and their plans for the future. Simply put, you’ll learn how the latest technology can transform the way you do your job and achieve your&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus this year is on opening the door to innovation — learning about the latest technology and its application, and breaking down the barriers to its&amp;nbsp;adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues you can expect to hear about at Gov 2.0 Summit&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * The Power of Platforms&lt;br /&gt;
    * Fueling the Innovation Economy&lt;br /&gt;
    * Identity, Privacy, and Informed Consent&lt;br /&gt;
    * Cost Savings and Doing More with Less&lt;br /&gt;
    * Empowering Citizens&lt;br /&gt;
    * Improving Government&amp;nbsp;Effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for you to request an invitation to attend this year’s event is now open. Last year’s event was sold out. Submit your request today and reserve your place in the&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Guide: Service Corps to Social Impact Career</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2009/6/guide-service-corps-to-social-impact-career</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Potthast of Idealist.org just released a new guide for service corps members who wish to transition to a &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt; in nonprofits. The &lt;a href=&quot;HTTP://idealist.org/servicecompanion&quot;&gt;guide is a free download&lt;/a&gt; and a companion to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealist.org/careerguide&quot;&gt;Idealist Guides to Nonprofit Careers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your participation in national or international service gives you an incredible starting point for a career and life with social impact. This is true whether you are a recent high school or college graduate, or an encore professional. For people early in their careers, service also offers an opportunity to build hands-on experience before applying to college or graduate&amp;nbsp;school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a service corps participant, your transition to a career or school is unique for several reasons. Right now you have an awesome opportunity to become part of the next wave of public service leaders. Projections indicate that from 2006 to 2016, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; nonprofits will need to attract and develop 640,000 new senior managers, or 2.4 times 2006&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By learning career transition skills during your term of service, you can plan your professional growth and prepare to assume leadership roles throughout your&amp;nbsp;career.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
