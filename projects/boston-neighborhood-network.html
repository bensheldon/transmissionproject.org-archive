        Project Description:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Alli, working as a VISTA volunteer, has filled a huge void for BNN by assisting in promotions and outreach to the community. Through her first six months at BNN she has assisted not only the organization, but BNN producers in getting their message&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>In Alli&#8217;s second year at BNN she held the position of Youth Media Coordinator. Her duties included organizing a teen media club and producing a monthly program with the teens in the&nbsp;club.</p>
</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="views-field-field-project-outcome-value">
          <label class="views-label-field-project-outcome-value">
        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>She is currently helping to organize, write, and format BNN’s quarterly newsletter, our most important piece of literature sent to our members.  The newsletter introduces new equipment in our facilities, editing and production tips, and production class schedules. BNN has been unable to produce a newsletter since last winter, due to lack of staff and time, so Alli’s assistance in this is especially crucial.  Once the newsletter is completed it will be mailed to approximately 500 members and BNN typically receives a positive response from a large number of&nbsp;recipients. </p>
<p>Another example of Alli’s reach to the community is BNN’s Neighborhood Network News Program Highlights which Alli has been in charge of for the past six months.  The Program Highlights require Alli to be in close contact to all of our producers and to contact various shows on a weekly basis.  The Highlights also require her to send out a bulk mailing each month encouraging producers to contact her and let her know about their show, so that BNN can assist them in reaching as many people in the community as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Not only is Alli reaching out to community members, but during the next six months a lot of her attention will go to reaching out to community organizations. BNN provides non-profit organizations in the Greater Boston area a chance to produce a PSA highlighting their organization’s cause.  Alli will be responsible for the production and editing of these PSA’s, and she will assist BNN’s Education/Outreach department in contacting the organizations through phone calls, mailings and most importantly a “Get Your Message Out”&nbsp;seminar. </p>
<p>Over the last six months Alli has been a vital part in increasing BNN’s reach to the Boston community.  She has kept daily communication with many of our producers and the productions that she has assisted on have gotten her out into the community and aided BNN in delivering community&nbsp;messages.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Scott came to BNN in September 2002.  He quickly became a valuable member of the BNN team, assisting with Ed/Out projects that promote BNN services, teaching video production, assisting members with non-linear editing, troubleshooting edit equipment, and producing public service announcements.  Scott has raised the production standards of BNN with his excellent editing and shooting skills.  He has also assisted with print promotions such as newsletters and&nbsp;flyers.</p>
<p>Due to Scott’s excellent production capabilities he was able to complete a number of PSAs, instructional videos, and community based programs for BNN.  Such programs included the 10 part series &#8220;Sister Talk 2,&#8221; a program aimed at African American women to raise awareness of cardiovascular health.  Scott assisted Barbara Barrow-Murray, BNN’s Roxbury Studio Manager, with editing the series.  Scott also played a large role in helping to modernize the look of the channel, creating promotional spots, and helping to improve the channel’s&nbsp;graphics.</p>

                <span class="field-content"><p>Derek has played a principal role in the planning and facilitation of the DigitalArt Youth Program, particularly in regard to working with youth ages 10-18. He developed and implemented multimedia activities for participants, including extra-curricular activities such as field trips and showcases around the city. At the same time he has produced several multimedia projects that have been used to educate people about the benefits of joining BNN. Also, he assists in helping BNN members produce digital video programs for the&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p>He created a web site for the BNN DigitalArt Youth Program and played a major role in updating and maintaining it: <a href="http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm" title="http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm">http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm</a>.  He also takes the lead in regard to developing content for programs at the BNN Multimedia Center, including digital video production for PSAs and multimedia presentations that are seen by BNN members and Boston public access TV&nbsp;viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to his major project activities, Derek has been more than willing to attend and participate in several center-related training sessions for community media and technology centers in the northeast region as well presenting at youth fairs and conferences.  Near the end of his assignment, Derek contributed to the monthly First Tuesday TV/Web program produced by the Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative and he continued to work with CBC and BNN for several months after his assignment&nbsp;ended.</p>

  <h4>Voices from the Field </h4>

  <div class="content"><blockquote><p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sarah was instrumental in expanding our outreach and services to a more diverse community. She really cared about our mission and allowed us to build up relationships in the community. It’s really rewarding to see the new people we’ve been able to reach and the effect our programs are now having on their&nbsp;lives.

“By concentrating on curriculum and training, Gariet made sure that the website would stay useful to the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program beyond just his year with&nbsp;us. </p>
<p>“Moving Images proved to be a great success for the <span class="caps">OLLIE</span> Youth Media program. The students produced excellent work that showcased their talents and reﬂ ected the positive experiences they had while participating in the program. Gariet was key to that&nbsp;success.”
