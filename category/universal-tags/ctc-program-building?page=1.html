She has improved our technical capacity by creating a shared calendar in outlook which enables the organization staff to access CTC hours and volunteer information. In order to better support and recognize our volunteers, Andrea has implemented a monthly newsletter that goes out to the public and also volunteer appreciation week in April.  In collaboration with the volunteer coordinator Andrea developed a recruitment plan for youth, LEP adults and seniors, which has greatly increased the number of volunteers at our sites and exceeded our recruiting&nbsp;goals.</p>

                    <p>Our two VISTA members have been instrumental in developing our community technology at the CCNV Homeless shelter. Wildtech has partnered with the Community for Creative Non-Violence the largest homeless shelter in the United States, to establish a community technology center (CTC) for the homeless at the&nbsp;shelter.</p>

                    <p>Our VISTAs have helped establish the technology center and develop resources for technology access and training programs for the shelter population, as well as other disadvantaged populations utilizing it. They have also laid the groundwork for building a self-sustaining service-learning model where trained members of the homeless community gain work-based learning experiences by performing vital technology repair and training services for local non-profit organizations and government agencies. Because of their work, the program has become famous,. The shelter now has quality computers, internet access and many of the 1300 residents are now getting their own computers. This success has been facilitated by the work of Tony and Larry, who have developed marketing and outreach materials, organized events and developed our list of partners and supporting organizations in the community. They have built the capacity of our organization by helping upgrade our constituent database so that we can better track donors and individuals. In regard to our programs, they have helped develop our curriculum and improve our process for refurbishing and distributing computers to program participants at the homeless&nbsp;shelter.</p>

                    <p>This year we had a number of major accomplishments with AJ McGuire, including establishing a new course at the Social Justice Academy called Committee, that has added a core of projects for teens to complete in after school. After school projects for example, are incorporating Action Research principles that allow students to examine issues such as Global Warming and it&#8217;s impact on energy consumption and lifestyles, and equity in education in the Boston Public Schools and at the Social eeJustice Academy. The after school Mosaic program screened their videos for the entire student body in March, and we continued to make connections with new teachers and students both during school and after school. We have increase the number of teens participating in After School to 17. Our program has expanded to three full days per week. Two of our teens from the Social Justice Academy After School continued to work in our Summer Intensive at the Boston Neighborhood Network (BNN) in the Mall of Roxbury, where AJ was the lead program developer. Working in teams of 5 with three other team leaders, AJ helped to develop the curriculum, developed a web site workspace where projects could be posted and created a web based project tracking system based on the Drupal programming&nbsp;language. </p>
<p>Both of our VISTAs have been very dedicated and resourceful in supporting the media lab after school initiatives. They have found themselves being passionate about our mission to help teens develop creative, multidisciplinary media and education projects that foster teamwork and communication skills, community building, insight into critical issues, and ways to express those issues to&nbsp;others.</p>

                    <p>Ray was responsible for managing our computer refurbishing lab, including creating a training program for refurbishing volunteers, researching an inventory system, developing and leading technology workshops for our students. While his work in the refurb lab was very valuable, his most significant accomplishment, and the one that was the biggest benefit to our organization, was the workshops he developed for our technology&nbsp;center.</p>

                    <p>Ray spent the year coming up with ideas for the workshops, creating the materials necessary to lead the workshops, and organizing the instructors of the workshops. Workshop topics included digital storytelling, silent movie-making, audio dubbing, and 3D imaging.  Ray learned how create (and advertise) workshops that are appealing to teens and eventually had regular attendance at them.   Students in our program earn a free computer system to take home. Our policy states that if they attend 5 workshops, they&#8217;ll earn enough extra credit to earn a year of free internet access at home. While nearly all of our students earn the home computer, many students weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of the free internet since they weren&#8217;t getting the opportunity to attend workshops. With Ray&#8217;s help, a great number of students were able to attend the workshops that are required in order to earn home internet. While having a home computer is valuable to our students, without internet they remain at a disadvantage when it comes to completing homework and projects for&nbsp;school. </p>
<p>Now that Ray&#8217;s term has ended we are happy to have a whole library of workshop ideas and materials at the ready. Because everything has already been developed, it is much easier for us to recruit volunteers to lead our workshops, since it no longer requires a significant time commitment on their part. We are pleased that we were able to, and will be able to continue to, offer so many workshops to our students and that they may earn internet access at&nbsp;home.</p>

He was able to successfully complete the objectives of Goal 1 for Quarter 1.  However, he was not able to complete Objective 2a, to implement an ESL class at the House for Senior Citizens at the Lockwood/Elmwood in Arlington, Virginia for two reasons.  First, the occupants did not feel the ESL class was necessary (they were only interested in learning about the Internet and computers).  Second, James was not able to recruit a volunteer to teach the class.  He did successfully complete Objectives 2b and&nbsp;2c.</p>
<p>For Quarter 3, James assisted a BPSOS staff in setting up new program for Victims of Trafficking.  He worked on this program for approximately one month and then he assisted another staff member with the Tax Assistance for Vietnamese Immigrants with Low Income (TAVILLI) program.  From January 1 through April 23, he organized tax preparation sessions 3 days a week, 2 hours each session.  He recruited volunteers and established a database containing names of volunteers that may help with future tax clinics.  He went out in the Vietnamese community and distributed 800 flyers advertising free tax preparation.  He enrolled 300 individuals for tax preparation, and kept a database of those individuals. When he enrolled the individuals for tax preparation, he gave out a needs assessment/opinion survey for them to complete. This survey informed individuals about programs available at BPSOS (computer, ESL and&nbsp;etc…).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was unable to complete the objectives as stated in Quarter 4 before the end of his one-year service because the first issue of BPSOS Mach Song was not published until July 2002.  However, he did update BPSOS newsletter database.   This database contains names of past and current BPSOS clients as well as others who want to receive the newsletter in the mail.   Articles written in the newsletter highlight human-interest stories as well as provide information of services available to&nbsp;individuals.</p>

                    <p>This has been an exciting year for our CTCNet VISTA here at the Durham Literacy Center.  Previous VISTAs have laid the framework for the progress that Brian Russell, this year’s VISTA, has made to date.  Overall, the VISTAs role is to (1) serve as technology integration specialist and oversee learning offerings, including:  PC Basics, ABE, GED, ESOL, Family Literacy and Career Passport; (2) provide web page maintenance and enhancement; and (3) develop technology volunteer&nbsp;plan.</p>

                    <p>The VISTA was responsible for maintaining and upgrading all of our agency’s computers and labs in addition to assisting in making agency-wide decisions as they pertained to technology.  By recruiting and supporting technical volunteers, Brian effectively juggled all of his duties.  Our VISTA provided excellent leadership as the co-chair of our ad-hoc tech committee and guided us through many important decisions regarding infrastructure, training and outreach.  Please see the 04-05 VISTA’s web-blog for details of some of the projects he worked on:  <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/" title="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/">http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/brian_russell/</a>.  However, only a few of his accomplishments are listed on his web log - the rest are highlighted&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.durhamliteracy.org" title="www.durhamliteracy.org">www.durhamliteracy.org</a> Website<br />
The VISTA provided superb research, advice, set-up, development and, ultimately, training to the full staff team on our new website.  After research, the VISTA recommended that we use a program called Civicspace.org, freeware with customizable authoring privileges and a straightforward authoring interface.  The new website has already attracted funders, individual donations, a multitude of volunteers and strengthened interaction with all of our stakeholders.  Each staff member has a blog and the ability to update content.   After the VISTA trained the staff on the basics of the webpage and setting policy, many staff have mastered the basics and have set up more features such as discussion forums for volunteers, calendaring and soon-to-be online&nbsp;forms. </p>
<p>IBM Grant Management<br />
As a beta testing site during this past fiscal year, Durham Literacy Center (DLC) English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) introduced the &#8220;Reading Recognition&#8221; program to approximately 130 students.   While there are still some rough spots in the early version of the application, many students indicated that &#8220;Reading Recognition&#8221; helped them improve their pronunciation, listening and&nbsp;reading.  </p>
<p>The VISTA coordinated volunteers to install 3 new computer labs at DLC and its partner-sites.  Work included installing software and setup on servers and clients, hardware setup.  The VISTA was instrumental in training staff, partners and end users on using the new computer lab and&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>Agency Policy Development<br />
The VISTA effectively researched and gained buy-in by staff and management on best practices for creating policies and procedures appropriate for a non-profit like the Durham Literacy Center.  The VISTA identified sample policies from other non-profits and counseled the management on policies to adopt.  These policies include, but are not limited to the following:<br />
•	Providing donations to partner agencies<br />
•	Laptop loans<br />
•	Use of the computer lab<br />
•	Website content and&nbsp;authoring</p>
<p>The Teen Career Academy<br />
The Teen Career Academy and the Duke Research Service Learning Project – The VISTA created a mobile lab using donated laptops.  The VISTA trained volunteers and teen students on how to use the GED interactive software program and others and tutored teens in the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Adult Literacy<br />
The VISTA participated in our volunteer training on the intensive reading instruction method called the Wilson Method.  From that point, Brian assisted in tutoring some adult literacy students and then led an in-service tutor training activity on the use of technology and in the initial pre-service tutor training&nbsp;session.</p>

                    <p>The Durham Literacy Center is very appreciative of the assistance and contributions that the Digital Arts Service Corps has provided to our partners and us.  Last year, 2004-2005, we were lucky to have a VISTA as knowledgeable and experienced as Brian Russell.  The VISTA took our agency to a new level – our technical infrastructure, integrity and our presentation to the outside world via the webpage are all at the strongest point they have been in&nbsp;years.</p>
