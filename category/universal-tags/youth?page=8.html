                    <p>Reel Works Teen Filmmaking is centered of the conviction that every young person has a story to tell and an important contribution to make our world. We believe that filmmaking holds within it essential disciplines of literacy, communication, creative and critical thinking, storytelling and teamwork that young people need to effectively express their unique visions. In the process they gain self-esteem, master state-of-the-art technology and are transformed from passive consumers to active creators of media. We say to teens: You have a voice. Use&nbsp;it! </p>
<p>Founded in 2001 at the Prospect Park YMCA, Reel Works is a full-time nonprofit arts organization that serves over 150 teens each year through five core programs: The Lab, The Master Class, Reel Impact, Reel Works Productions and the Summer&nbsp;Lab.</p>

                    <p>Amplifyme is a nonprofit organization that engages people in positive change through the use of media arts. We use pop culture to inspire people to think differently about their power to create change in their lives and the lives of others through civic&nbsp;engagement.</p>
<p>Amplifyme programs provide opportunities for engagement in positive change through the media arts. Our programs focus in four key areas—Media, Music, Video and the Electronic Community. More and more, these methods of communication influence people, both young and old. Unfortunately, not all of these messages are positive. amplifyme’s programs empower participants to create positive messages to reach a broad audience to foster civic&nbsp;engagement.</p>
<p>These programs begin with youth involvement, but are also appropriate for individuals further along in their professional development and who want to participate as a vehicle for change in the&nbsp;media.</p>
<p>- youth media institute Empowers young people with the tools and resources to become future leaders in the media&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>- empowerment music program Works with musicians to produce socially empowering commercially viable music&nbsp;messages.</p>
<p>- movement pictures video program Works with video artists to create and amplify socially responsible video messages in film and&nbsp;television.</p>
<p>- electronic community media program Serves as an online hub for all of amplifyme&#8217;s signature programs, as well as an interactive site for socially responsible music, video, and online community&nbsp;building.</p>

                    <p>Intermedia Arts is Minnesota&#8217;s premier multidisciplinary, multicultural organization. Our mission is to by a catalyst that builds understanding among people through&nbsp;art. </p>
<p>PCTV empowers young people to engage with their communities through learning, teaching and making media. For 15 year, PCTV has taught thousands of Minneapolis teens how to make their own TV shows, video diaries, photo essays, webpages and other media&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>The PCTV crew creates a bi-weekly talk show called Our Turn, a online gallery featuring web design, photography and, creative writing called Mixed Visions, video essays, and other media products. These creative projects reflect public concerns and document work by youth in their neighborhoods. Participants of PCTV, and the schools they are selected from, demonstrate a strong commitment to community service and to engaging young people outside the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
<p>Through their involvement with PCTV, participants develop skills in media literacy, video production and design, including techniques in camera operation, sound, lighting, and editing. They also gain abilities in photography and web design and layout. Simultaneously, students begin strengthening community ties and educating others on important issues. By practicing what it means to be part of a media crew and how to fit in roles such as a director, producer, host, editor, and other operations youth find themselves filled with knowledge and skills enhancing their futures in media&nbsp;production.</p>

                    <p>Our mission is to develop the skills of youth and their families so that they are empowered to enhance their own lives and build a strong and vibrant urban community. All of our programs are developed by residents in response to community needs. Since its founding, the Hyde Square Task Force has developed on-going programs for youth and families that not only help them advance at school and in careers, but also help create positive relations and opportunities to take pride and action in our&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Hyde Square Task Force youth are leaders within the organization and beyond, helping to diminish negative stereotypes of urban youth with their positive energy and dedication to improving their community. In each of our high-intensity youth teams, participants ages 14-21 receive specialized training and participate in 6-15 hours of community-building and youth development activities each week.  Youth develop leadership skills through our core curriculum, while acting as instructors and role models for younger children in our elementary and middle school&nbsp;programs</p>

                    <p>HOLA&#8217;s youth attend overburdened inner city schools, live in communities that are heavily impacted by illegal drug trafficking and gang violence and many children are hindered by poverty and immigration&nbsp;status. </p>
<p>VISION<br />
Hundreds of underserved children are traveling across one end of a beautiful green park with backpacks and musical instruments or athletics gear, through families perched under trees on blankets reading a book or painting in the middle of this community campus while others play sports, on their way to another green building met by inspirational teachers, coaches, parents and mentors, everyone is coming together and sharing, everyone is&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p>One of LA’s best kept secrets started in a church gym and almost 20 years later has grown into a vibrant community oasis for thousands of inner-city youth.  HOLA is a thriving center that serves the Rampart community with programs in academics, the arts and athletics.  The organization is unique in the quality of instruction and individual attention it provides to youth ages 6 to&nbsp;19.</p>
<p>HOLA’s campus, located in and around Lafayette Park, is a home away from home for hundreds of kids.  They know that they will get the help they need from HOLA’s professional staff and highly talented volunteers.  Through HOLA’s extensive volunteer program, the youth are exposed to a wide array of experts including artists, executives, chefs, athletes, engineers, and counselors who truly commit themselves to providing programs of the highest quality, giving kids the best chance to become successful in&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Through HOLA’s unique partnership with the LA City Recreation and Parks Department, students living in poverty have much needed green space – a state of the art field turf soccer field, outdoor basketball courts, and a brand new gym that is currently under construction.*  Best of all, these facilities are safe spaces, open year round, truly offering the youth of the community an alternative to hanging out on the&nbsp;streets.</p>

                    <p>Heads on Fire partners with social change agencies and community technology companies to provide technology access and education, primarily for youth, in underserved areas. Most of the work takes place after school and in the summer, at sites around the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>Activities are divided into three&nbsp;areas:</p>
<p>The [i]-Team provides digital literacy&nbsp;instruction.</p>
<p>ECHOES magazine helps youth use digital technology to document stories of community interest.<br />
This nationally distributed CD-ROM magazine contains multimedia journalism pieces as well as entertainment sections such as music and game reviews.<br />
Working in close partnership with Christina Glavas, of Minds Wide Open, ECHOES provides training in journalism, digital photography, video editing, audio production, and interactive game design.<br />
Participants work on Saturdays to develop their design skills and take part in a global education curriculum project. Themes such as imagery, oral histories, languages, community orientation, cultural heritage, and other international issues are used as a context for the work.<br />
The work includes traveling to different sites to conduct interviews, as well as production and design time spent in the lab.<br />
The ECHOES training is free and open to youth in San Diego between the ages of 14–18. There is an application process, and participants must be willing to make a ten-month&nbsp;commitment.</p>
<p>The Sunscreens series features the digital work of youth in a two-month gallery exhibit, based on an annual theme.<br />
Each show includes a display of pieces on gallery walls, programs of audio-visual recordings, and interactive kiosks display works created for the computer and the web.<br />
The theme for 2004 was artistic statements made either by or about young Californians who are a part of communities in distress. These included communities affected by crime, poverty, gangs, racism, health crises, refugee status, or social&nbsp;injustice.</p>

                    <p>We see a future where the children of Friendship House graduate from high school, from technical school, from college, with a meaningful education and a full compliment of life skills. We see a future where our kids are getting and keeping good paying jobs with benefits and the potential for advancement. We see the people who graduate from our program owning homes, buying goods and services, starting businesses, and paying taxes. We see them being actively involved in civic and social affairs and working collectively to improve and strengthen our community and the community of Billings at large. This is what breaking the cycle of poverty looks like and that&#8217;s what we are&nbsp;doing. </p>
<p>The &#8220;digital divide&#8221; is very real in our neighborhood. In June 2004 we made a commitment to significantly strengthen the academic and technological components of our youth development program. We have invested more than $150,000 in this effort to date. Currently, only children and teens enrolled in our programs have access to our computers and related technologies. So we are constructing an addition to the building that will become a Community Technology Center (CTC) and allow us to share these resources with the entire community. When people lack access to the technology that is defining our economy and its job market and they lack the skills to use this technology, they find themselves at a distinct disadvantage. Our expanded CTC will provide education and skill building opportunities to community members of all ages and abilities in an environment supportive of&nbsp;learning.</p>
