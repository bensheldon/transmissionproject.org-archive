                    <p>Ray was responsible for managing our computer refurbishing lab, including creating a training program for refurbishing volunteers, researching an inventory system, developing and leading technology workshops for our students. While his work in the refurb lab was very valuable, his most significant accomplishment, and the one that was the biggest benefit to our organization, was the workshops he developed for our technology&nbsp;center.</p>

                    <p>Ray spent the year coming up with ideas for the workshops, creating the materials necessary to lead the workshops, and organizing the instructors of the workshops. Workshop topics included digital storytelling, silent movie-making, audio dubbing, and 3D imaging.  Ray learned how create (and advertise) workshops that are appealing to teens and eventually had regular attendance at them.   Students in our program earn a free computer system to take home. Our policy states that if they attend 5 workshops, they&#8217;ll earn enough extra credit to earn a year of free internet access at home. While nearly all of our students earn the home computer, many students weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of the free internet since they weren&#8217;t getting the opportunity to attend workshops. With Ray&#8217;s help, a great number of students were able to attend the workshops that are required in order to earn home internet. While having a home computer is valuable to our students, without internet they remain at a disadvantage when it comes to completing homework and projects for&nbsp;school. </p>
<p>Now that Ray&#8217;s term has ended we are happy to have a whole library of workshop ideas and materials at the ready. Because everything has already been developed, it is much easier for us to recruit volunteers to lead our workshops, since it no longer requires a significant time commitment on their part. We are pleased that we were able to, and will be able to continue to, offer so many workshops to our students and that they may earn internet access at&nbsp;home.</p>

                    <p>Richard was a crucial part of the Mollie youth video team, providing youth access and exposure to digital video technology during Mollie moviemaking video projects with schools and community groups.

                    <p>Richard assisted the education department with youth outreach curriculum development efforts, developing innovative ways to expose community youth to digital audio and video technology. He developed interest surveys for school and community info. gathering and assisted with the implementation of an open house for CMC Wealthy neighborhood residents. Richard was a member of the SMART Festival planning team, an international student media arts festival organized and hosted by&nbsp;GRCMC..</p>
<p>A particular story that stands out is the use of audio resources and curriculum developed by Richard: There was a young man named Patrick who was 14 years of age and lived across the street from Media Center with his Mom and 6 brothers and sisters. He would drop by the media center often after school. He learned a variety of video production skills and produced a few short studio productions for air on community television, but nothing seemed to really stick with him.  One day we asked him to produce and record a rap that could be used for promotion of the Mollie youth program. You could see the excitement in his eyes at that suggestion. In a matter of weeks he had the rap written out and beats to use with it created on the computer.  Using the tools and resources Richard had collected and organized, we were able to both find a passion for this young man and help promote our programs and&nbsp;organization.</p>

                    <p>Michelle’s main goals since joining the YMCA have been to work both with the YMCA programs and the wider community to increase the visibility and programming of the CyberY. She has not only created some resources, but has also placed a priority on using resources that already exist, so as to not recreate the&nbsp;wheel.</p>

                    <p>• Michelle helped to increase the time MCA/School aged childcare program (SACC) is doing educational activities in the lab, particularly around a lesson plan for the after school on how to create their own newsletter using the creativity and technology in the Cyber&nbsp;Y. </p>
<p>• Michelle has completed a three-week introduction to computers course that had five&nbsp;participants. </p>
<p>• During her first month, Michelle helped to write a grant to partner with the Ecumenical Social Action Council to do a graphics training project with youth. It is hoped that two out of the 12 youth will take a leadership role to make this project happen next&nbsp;year. </p>
<p>• Michelle has been working closely with other tax sites, staff, and the CyberY Developer to make this a successful&nbsp;project. </p>
<p>• Weight Watchers—met with the program to discuss how they could use the&nbsp;CyberY. </p>
<p>• Timothy Smith Network—working to secure and implement the Kinetic City&nbsp;program.</p>

                    <p>Ria has done a good job of connecting with schools and organizations to<br />
create alliances for projects and for recruitment. Ria hasalso  been wonderfully effective at recruiting guest speakers and field trip hosts for&nbsp;GGD.</p>
<p>Ria has done a wonderful job of preparing program information for the public, including the fall GGD update (sent to funders and partner agencies) and the December graduation flier. Because the program’s outreach has been so successful, there has not been a need for the extensive outreach we have had in the&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>I believe Ria’s work on program curriculum and her work in the classroom will be one of her greatest legacies in the program. She has developed strong curricula and has led successful, creative classes. She has developed curriculum for and taught the fall and spring classes and has developed a proposal for a summer video program. Her teaching style with the students has been steadily improving, and her comfort level and ability in working with students in and out of the classroom has been a pleasure to watch&nbsp;grow.</p>

                    <p>Abby’s year with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE) was characterized by a  transition of the project  from a previous role of working in traditional classrooms to a new service area involving after-school programming for at risk children. Over half of the jobs MoLLIE took in the 2004-05 school year were at after school centers run by the School district in conjunction with the city Parks and Recreation&nbsp;Department.</p>
<p>MoLLIE taught participating children how to write, shoot, and edit, for cablecast, their own curriculum-linked skits, PSAs, and mini documentaries.  As a MoLLIE trainer/technician, Abby was essential to the success of those&nbsp;programs.</p>

            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>Other ongoing projects that Abby was crucial to the success of&nbsp;included:</p>
<p>- “Project Safe Neighborhoods” (U.S. Department of Justice) in which Abby facilitated the efforts of local youths at neighborhood associations and community centers in writing, shooting, performing, and editing their own Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on the subject of gun violence&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>-  Wedgwood Christian Services of West Michigan.  Similar to PSN, the Wedgwood project involved providing at-risk teens with the tools, training, and  means of transmission to create their own mini documentaries and PSAs focusing on substance abuse&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>Both of these long term projects have been very successful due in large part to Abby’s commitment, diligence, professionalism, expertise, and willingness to work with at risk&nbsp;teens.</p>
<p>Abby’s final, and perhaps most lasting project, done in conjunction with previous VISTA/Americorps volunteers Laura Craig-Bennett, Amy McKenzie, and Jennifer Harris, has been the editing of a four-episode series of documentaries entitled “Girls to Governors” which commemorates the role of  Michigan women in politics.  Funded locally by the Nokomis foundation of Grand Rapids, the VISTA/Americorps producers of “Girls to Governors” seized upon the election in 2001 of Michigan&#8217;s first female governor, to examine the emerging role of women in local, state, and national politics and public&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>The editing of this series was the capstone event in and outstanding year of service provided by VISTA volunteer Abby Balazs.  The VISTA program should be very proud to have Abby as an alumnae just as we are proud to have had her as an employee and team&nbsp;mate.</p>

She is enthusiastic and very effective as a teacher, especially in a one-on-one setting.  She has a warmth and a focus that children are very responsive to. Abby is setting a very high standard of performance in all aspects of her job with MoLLIE, and I am happy to have her as a member of the&nbsp;team.</p>

<p>Goal 1:  To provide access to technology to the low-income Latino&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Goal 2:  To provide access to better job opportunities with living&nbsp;wages.</p>
<p>Goal 3:  Public and private sector resources will enable the project to continue after the member&nbsp;leaves.</p>

                    <p>Gregory has designed an exciting new curriculum as well as a long-term multimedia plan for the school. Students truly enjoy and benefit from these classes and we look forward to building on this aspect of our program in the future. The students welcome the creative outlets these classes provide as a balance to the MS office applications and the technical computer repair classes we offer. As previously reported, this instruction has been given not only to students but to staff as&nbsp;well. </p>
<p>In the web design class students continue to work on non-profit site projects under Gregory’s advisory oversight. Several students are now independently building and maintaining websites for neighborhood non-profit&nbsp;organizations.</p>
<p>Gregory has almost completed the Spanish mirror of our bi-lingual website and he remains solely responsible for the web presence and staff accounts. He continues to work with staff and students in completing and maintaining CAMINOS’ website.
