 <title>Grassroots Use of Technology Conference</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2009/10/grassroots-use-of-technology-conference</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to get your organization online right away with a website or blog? Did you ever wonder how Facebook or Twitter can be made useful for your outreach? How about using free and easy tech tools to schedule meetings, conference online or over the telephone?&lt;br /&gt;
What about those “webinars” and other tools to train your members? How about using online surveys to collect feedback or make decisions? And what about working with members across several different&amp;nbsp;languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of these questions apply to you, the Grassroots Use of Technology Conference (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GrassrootsTech.org&quot; title=&quot;http://www.GrassrootsTech.org&quot;&gt;http://www.GrassrootsTech.org&lt;/a&gt;) is for you!&lt;br /&gt;
Bring your laptop to the workshops and we’ll help you jumpstart your online presence before you&amp;nbsp;leave!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$75 - Registration (includes breakfast and lunch on Saturday, Oct. 17th) &lt;br /&gt;
$35 - Low income, student, or unemployed rate  (A limited number of scholarships are available, see website for&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s going&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10th Annual Grassroots Use of Technology Conference (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GUT&lt;/span&gt;-C X)&lt;br /&gt;
takes place in just under 4 weeks!  - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GrassrootsTech.org&quot; title=&quot;http://www.GrassrootsTech.org&quot;&gt;http://www.GrassrootsTech.org&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GUT&lt;/span&gt;-C X brings together hundreds of grassroots and social change organizers with media activists, writers, and techies from all over New&amp;nbsp;England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we have an array of workshops that focus on social media and organizing work &amp;#8211;geared towards both beginners and experts.  Topics branch out into: creating websites, building rapid response networks, using databases and e-mail lists, fundraising and “micro” donations, community art, virtual worlds, and more. Rather than offering a blind “techno-lust,” the conference engages in levelheaded thinking about using the latest technologies towards the strategic objectives of an organization for both problem solving and&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organized in tandem with the National Writers Union&amp;#8217;s Digital Media Conference, it will feature programming that looks at the implications of digital tech for content creation.  &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GUT&lt;/span&gt;-C X is looking forward to a diverse turnout from immigrants, communities of color, labor organizations, and peace movement groups and will also act as a platform for regional work on the Detroit 2010 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Social Forum!  Conference highlights will include a keynote address, “Connecting the Disconnected,” by Professor Richard O&amp;#8217;Bryant (Northeastern University) and a lunchtime dialogue between techies and organizers coordinated by&amp;nbsp;smartMEME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary conference organizers are the Organizers&amp;#8217; Collaborative, the John O&amp;#8217;Bryant African American Institute, Boston Neighborhood Network &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, the National Writers Union, and Massachusetts Global&amp;nbsp;Action.  &lt;/p&gt;
