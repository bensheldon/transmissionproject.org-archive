                    <p>Abby’s year with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE) was characterized by a  transition of the project  from a previous role of working in traditional classrooms to a new service area involving after-school programming for at risk children. Over half of the jobs MoLLIE took in the 2004-05 school year were at after school centers run by the School district in conjunction with the city Parks and Recreation&nbsp;Department.</p>
<p>MoLLIE taught participating children how to write, shoot, and edit, for cablecast, their own curriculum-linked skits, PSAs, and mini documentaries.  As a MoLLIE trainer/technician, Abby was essential to the success of those&nbsp;programs.</p>

            <div class="field-item odd">
                    <p>Other ongoing projects that Abby was crucial to the success of&nbsp;included:</p>
<p>- “Project Safe Neighborhoods” (U.S. Department of Justice) in which Abby facilitated the efforts of local youths at neighborhood associations and community centers in writing, shooting, performing, and editing their own Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on the subject of gun violence&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>-  Wedgwood Christian Services of West Michigan.  Similar to PSN, the Wedgwood project involved providing at-risk teens with the tools, training, and  means of transmission to create their own mini documentaries and PSAs focusing on substance abuse&nbsp;prevention.</p>
<p>Both of these long term projects have been very successful due in large part to Abby’s commitment, diligence, professionalism, expertise, and willingness to work with at risk&nbsp;teens.</p>
<p>Abby’s final, and perhaps most lasting project, done in conjunction with previous VISTA/Americorps volunteers Laura Craig-Bennett, Amy McKenzie, and Jennifer Harris, has been the editing of a four-episode series of documentaries entitled “Girls to Governors” which commemorates the role of  Michigan women in politics.  Funded locally by the Nokomis foundation of Grand Rapids, the VISTA/Americorps producers of “Girls to Governors” seized upon the election in 2001 of Michigan&#8217;s first female governor, to examine the emerging role of women in local, state, and national politics and public&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>The editing of this series was the capstone event in and outstanding year of service provided by VISTA volunteer Abby Balazs.  The VISTA program should be very proud to have Abby as an alumnae just as we are proud to have had her as an employee and team&nbsp;mate.</p>

                    <p>Abby brings with her a high degree of expertise in her field which she is eager to share with students and colleagues alike.  She is enthusiastic and very effective as a teacher, especially in a one-on-one setting.  She has a warmth and a focus that children are very responsive to. Abby is setting a very high standard of performance in all aspects of her job with MoLLIE, and I am happy to have her as a member of the&nbsp;team.</p>

                    <p>Our project to date has had good results, we finished last years with the Bridges to Digital Excellence (BDE) program donating 742 total computers and training to students in grades three through eight.  As of today we are at 793 Families that have completed our program.  Becky has done a good job of running operations for the Computers in the Home part of&nbsp;BDE.</p>
<p>As of the beginning of this year’s program which started the last week of February Becky has managed all aspects of the program except purchasing of computers. As I did when we first started the BDE program there were some bumps in the road but things came together.  The same has happed with Becky leading the Computers In the Home program now.  I have full confidence in her abilities to continue the excellence and maintain standards that we strive for.  Our one outlying goal is to have the program we put on compete with the best programs in the world.  To my knowledge there is not another program in the country that is striving to bridge the digital divide as quickly and efficiently as this program is.  We are estimating that by the end of next year every child across Berrien County in grades three through eight will have a computer in their home.  We know that with the 793 families that have completed the program we have had 1586 people in the program and that more than 3000 individuals have been indirectly affected by the BDE program providing technology to so many homes. We want to see Becky continue to take advantage of the wealth of passion for the work we do. At our monthly steering committee meetings she gets to sit with the upper level IT management from almost every major employer in our community.  She has been exposed to a brainstorming technique that was developed by Whirlpool Corp. called an &#8220;Ideation Session&#8221; and how it can be used to expel ideas from a group that are there but people just don’t realize.  Becky also worked on a project for a development company; she wrote a proposal for a local art house to integrate technology into&nbsp;storytelling.</p>
<p>In her second year, Becky has effectively taken on all operations of the computers in the home program and is doing a good job running the program.  We are looking forward to reaching our 1000th family by the end of&nbsp;2005.</p>

                    <p>Sharon has shown only the utmost dedication to the Cyber Y and has helped nurture our afterschool programming into a highly successful and sought after community afterschool option for our neighborhood. The first class was an overwhelming success with high retention and participation from our local 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders. This semester we added one day of programming and now offer Cyber Y afterschool for 3rd and 4th together and a separate class for the 5th&nbsp;graders. </p>
<p>In addition, Sharon has also worked closely with the Cyber Seniors class that meets once a week and provides ongoing instruction support and recruitment for the class. She also developed an open access time one morning a week in order to provide additional out of class time to participants to have more computer usage time. Starting with only a couple of attendees, word of mouth has quickly filled up this morning&nbsp;time.</p>

                    <p>Derek has played a principal role in the planning and facilitation of the DigitalArt Youth Program, particularly in regard to working with youth ages 10-18. He developed and implemented multimedia activities for participants, including extra-curricular activities such as field trips and showcases around the city. At the same time he has produced several multimedia projects that have been used to educate people about the benefits of joining BNN. Also, he assists in helping BNN members produce digital video programs for the&nbsp;channels.</p>
<p>He created a web site for the BNN DigitalArt Youth Program and played a major role in updating and maintaining it: <a href="http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm" title="http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm">http://www.bnntv.org/day/index.htm</a>.  He also takes the lead in regard to developing content for programs at the BNN Multimedia Center, including digital video production for PSAs and multimedia presentations that are seen by BNN members and Boston public access TV&nbsp;viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to his major project activities, Derek has been more than willing to attend and participate in several center-related training sessions for community media and technology centers in the northeast region as well presenting at youth fairs and conferences.  Near the end of his assignment, Derek contributed to the monthly First Tuesday TV/Web program produced by the Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative and he continued to work with CBC and BNN for several months after his assignment&nbsp;ended.</p>

He has taught himself a web design program (TrellixWeb) and has been teaching youth in the Center on an ongoing basis.  We plan to continue the video course with the first group as well as offer the program to other&nbsp;youth.</p>

                    <p>Russell has engaged with youth in the target population to determine their goals, desires, issues, etc. to aid in planning for future programs.  His approachability makes him very accessible to any age group, which has enhanced his ability to engage and retain the interest of a small core in the target age group (youth aged 13-20).   While that core remains small (7-15), it is a large step for this organization.  We also have a number of youth who are just approaching the target age group, and they are already engaged in activities at the Center, including those that Russell has initiated.  We are confident that, rather than lose them as has happened in the past, we will retain them in our&nbsp;programs.</p>

                    <p>Douglas worked with Duke University faculty and students to develop CLICK (Creating Literacy in Computer Knowledge), a computer literacy training program for 6th graders. CLICK develops computer skills for at-risk middle school students, engaging them in an after-school setting that is interactive and fun. CLICK lessons include Internet research, word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and multimedia presentations. The website (<a href="http://www.duke.edu/web/isis/click/about.html" title="http://www.duke.edu/web/isis/click/about.html">http://www.duke.edu/web/isis/click/about.html</a>) contains downloadable lesson plans and teaching modules, as well as tips and hints for starting up a technology training&nbsp;class.</p>

                    <p>Douglas worked very well with Duke&#8217;s faculty and students. He recruited and trained students to teach CLICK, and he worked with the faculty and staff of the ISIS (Information Science and Information Studies) certificate program, primarily Edward A. Shanken, Executive Director, and Katie Watchman, Program&nbsp;Coordinator.</p>
<p>Douglas is now a graduate student in Biomedical Engineering at&nbsp;Duke.</p>
