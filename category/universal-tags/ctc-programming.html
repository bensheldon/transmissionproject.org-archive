                    <p>David has assisted TSN Coordinator with the procurement, development, distribution and evaluation of instructional materials for member&nbsp;sites.  </p>
<p>David has met with eligible sites independently and jointly with TSN coordinator as well as helped procure and disseminate information between sites and the TSN coordinator.  Because of David’s technical background and ability to grasp the complete picture he has resolved many problems and questions before they could become issues.  Once the financial issues are resolved, David will independently visit the Centers receiving equipment to ensure that its installation is complete and satisfies the Center’s requirements.  As a result of the David’s assistance the current round of hardware and furniture upgrades is ahead of last years&nbsp;pace. </p>
<p>David is serving as the Project Manager for the re-design of the website). Davis is coordinating the translation of a portion of the website into Spanish and is keeping the content of the web site up to date.  David frequently provides help desk support to members using the&nbsp;site. </p>
<p>David is currently serving as a fifth-grade group leader for the Kinetic City program. Kinetic City is a science-based program aligned with Boston Public School standards for grades 3-6 designed to be offered in out-of school time. David along with key staff from member sites will be trained to both run the program and sites as well as on how to train others to lead the program.  David will provide important feedback as we pilot this train-the-trainer program being developed jointly with MIT’s Kavli&nbsp;Institute.  </p>
<p>• David has developed and is maintaining two databases for managing the information needed for reporting to our funders—Boston Connects, Inc. and the Timothy Smith Fund. These databases track information for 40 sites, hundreds of classes, and thousands of&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>• David completed a series of classes at BNN TV’s Multimedia Center and used these new skills to video the recent Girls Get Connected Conference.  It is anticipated that he will turn this into a CD or DVD which can be used for publicity for upcoming conferences.  David will also use these skills to create a CD or DVD of success stories of individuCenter&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>I must take this opportunity to comment on David directly.  He demonstrates a level of maturity far beyond that which I have seen from others in his position.  His attention to detail and in depth-technical skills have has enabled him to successfully create and<br />
maintain the databases critical to the TSN’s daily operation.  David’s work ethic is outstanding—he is never late, he is never absent, he never complains, he is totally reliable.  If I give his something to get done he does it on time and accurately with a minimum of input, much less supervision.  David demonstrates real depth and breadth of perspective in meetings with funders, meeting with TS Center staff, and in meetings with the TSN Steering Committee.  Of particular note is the “business acumen” he applies to the TSN which he acquired through planning his business in&nbsp;Milwaukee.</p>

CLICK develops computer skills for at-risk middle school students, engaging them in an after-school setting that is interactive and fun. CLICK lessons include Internet research, word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and multimedia presentations.

                    <p>This year has been successful, for we conducted the following classes here at the Riley Hill Technology Center:  Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, as well as Introduction to the personal computer. The total number of students attending was 54. As Ella says, “I was blessed with seven volunteer instructors by advertising in the community. I was also privileged to teach Microsoft Word with an Introduction to the Personal&nbsp;Computer.”</p>
<p>A Computer Repair course was developed for Riley Hill Community Technology Center. Ella decided to use two resources to develop this course: Computer Concepts (Third Edition) and Technology for Social Change&#8217;s curriculum (<a href="http://www.tecschange.org" title="www.tecschange.org">www.tecschange.org</a>) with their permission. Ella also planned to use the RTPnet site as a reference for this&nbsp;course.</p>

                    <p>Developing this course has helped Ella to better troubleshoot computers, for there are individuals in the community that are in dire need of help.  These individuals bring their personal computers to the center for technical support. In the Wendell Community and surrounding areas, the Riley Hill Technology Center is the only source that does not charge a fee for&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>We very grateful to add our source of Volunteers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Technology Resources. We have used the following sources this year&nbsp;(2003-2004):</p>
<p>•	Schools (K-12) students as well as other personnel<br />
•	Community Colleges<br />
•	Libraries (Public and Other)<br />
•	Local businesses<br />
•	Wake Forest Pediatrics (Wake Forest, NC)<br />
•	Churches (Wakefield, Zebulon First Baptist etc.)<br />
•	RTP.net (Website)<br />
•	Family and Friends of staff members<br />
•	Department of Social Services (Eastern Regional Center, Zebulon)<br />
•	Retired Senior&nbsp;citizens</p>
<p>The quality of life has improved for the youth and adults who have taken computer classes at the center, however updating the computer equipment as well as software is still needed. We are currently looking for funding for this project and for a long-term way of sustaining the center.  The Riley Hill Survey Plan has given some insight on how to get this plan&nbsp;implemented.</p>

                    <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ella has done an outstanding job in coordinating and teaching classes as mentioned in her report this period. She is very dependable, very cooperative, a team player, and continues to be an asset to the Riley Hill Community. Her interaction with others (peers, youth, students, etc.) is outstanding. During this time period, there have not been any negative comments received regarding Ella. To sum it up, I would rate her as &#8216;Consistently Exceeds&#8217; the requirements in all aspects of the job.&#8221;<br />

<p>Goal 1: To develop a curriculum for the contextualized literacy program and determine its effectiveness.<br />
Goal 2: To secure adoption of the contextualized literacy program by the American Association of Community Colleges.<br />
Goal 3: To develop forms and procedures for BT to use in connection with the contextualized literacy program.<br />
Goal 4: To develop community partnerships for BT’s Smarthood.net program and CTCs through partner&nbsp;outreach.</p>

                    <p>In specific terms: in respect to Goal #1, we have in fact created a contextualized literacy program in response to the previously assessed needs of the A+ candidates.  In conjunction with the curriculum we have produced the necessary adjoining workbook. At this time we have just completed our first test run of this curriculum, we are currently gathering and analyzing the feedback from subjects along with our partnering organizations.  To date the response has been overwhelmingly positive.  We are now moving to incorporate this data into the program&nbsp;itself.  </p>
<p>As to Goal #2 the materials are currently under review by the AACC.  We are expecting helpful feedback and an overall smooth process. At this point in time the curriculum remains under advisement with the&nbsp;AACC.</p>
<p>On Goal #3 we have created and put in place specific operating agreements with our various partner organizations.  As these agreements were drafted by a VISTA who is a lawyer, they are professionally created and agreed upon by all&nbsp;concerned.</p>
