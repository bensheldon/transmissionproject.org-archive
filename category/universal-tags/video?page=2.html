                    <p>Girls Get Digital trains women in the use of media; program participants create multimedia resources for local nonprofits and other clients. GGD was able to see the fruits of our labor during our pilot year. As in the first half of her year with the program, Kathy was the keystone of our success, though additionally exciting was watching Kathy truly come into her own in her coordination of the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>A strong curriculum was created in our pilot year. This is under constant review and reconstruction, but curriculum work (including reflection on what worked and what should be changed) in the first year has created a strong foundation for&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>The GGD application and program evaluation documentation was created prior to the first session and has needed very little revision since.  Documentation for the rest of the program was created on as-need basis, and has largely followed guidelines by our summer session funder, which provided a standard set of consents, incident reports,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Kathy did a great job conducting outreach in schools, through local social service organizations and in clubs for participant recruitment. Kathy also did great work with a volunteer and the Multimedia Instructor to identify field trip&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>Kathy’s excellent research and writing skills were a huge asset to the program and resulted in our funding by AfterSchool Matters (for the summer and now the fall GGD sessions) and for our very first foundation&nbsp;funding.</p>
<p>Kathy developed and circulated press releases. The newsletter was tabled for the time being, and is now being developed by our current VISTA&nbsp;staff.</p>
<p>Initial work on identifying local program and online resources for program participants was completed. In a city as populated and large as Chicago, an exhaustive resource library is a Herculean task. Kathy assisted with the foundations for this library and the task is being carried on with staff at this&nbsp;time.</p>

                    <p>Ray was responsible for managing our computer refurbishing lab, including creating a training program for refurbishing volunteers, researching an inventory system, developing and leading technology workshops for our students. While his work in the refurb lab was very valuable, his most significant accomplishment, and the one that was the biggest benefit to our organization, was the workshops he developed for our technology&nbsp;center.</p>

                    <p>Ray spent the year coming up with ideas for the workshops, creating the materials necessary to lead the workshops, and organizing the instructors of the workshops. Workshop topics included digital storytelling, silent movie-making, audio dubbing, and 3D imaging.  Ray learned how create (and advertise) workshops that are appealing to teens and eventually had regular attendance at them.   Students in our program earn a free computer system to take home. Our policy states that if they attend 5 workshops, they&#8217;ll earn enough extra credit to earn a year of free internet access at home. While nearly all of our students earn the home computer, many students weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of the free internet since they weren&#8217;t getting the opportunity to attend workshops. With Ray&#8217;s help, a great number of students were able to attend the workshops that are required in order to earn home internet. While having a home computer is valuable to our students, without internet they remain at a disadvantage when it comes to completing homework and projects for&nbsp;school. </p>
<p>Now that Ray&#8217;s term has ended we are happy to have a whole library of workshop ideas and materials at the ready. Because everything has already been developed, it is much easier for us to recruit volunteers to lead our workshops, since it no longer requires a significant time commitment on their part. We are pleased that we were able to, and will be able to continue to, offer so many workshops to our students and that they may earn internet access at&nbsp;home.</p>

                    <p>Richard was a crucial part of the Mollie youth video team, providing youth access and exposure to digital video technology during Mollie moviemaking video projects with schools and community groups.

                    <p>Richard assisted the education department with youth outreach curriculum development efforts, developing innovative ways to expose community youth to digital audio and video technology. He developed interest surveys for school and community info. gathering and assisted with the implementation of an open house for CMC Wealthy neighborhood residents. Richard was a member of the SMART Festival planning team, an international student media arts festival organized and hosted by&nbsp;GRCMC..</p>
<p>A particular story that stands out is the use of audio resources and curriculum developed by Richard: There was a young man named Patrick who was 14 years of age and lived across the street from Media Center with his Mom and 6 brothers and sisters. He would drop by the media center often after school. He learned a variety of video production skills and produced a few short studio productions for air on community television, but nothing seemed to really stick with him.  One day we asked him to produce and record a rap that could be used for promotion of the Mollie youth program. You could see the excitement in his eyes at that suggestion. In a matter of weeks he had the rap written out and beats to use with it created on the computer.  Using the tools and resources Richard had collected and organized, we were able to both find a passion for this young man and help promote our programs and&nbsp;organization.</p>

                    <p>Laura’s year with the Mobile Learning Lab for Information Education (MoLLIE) was characterized by a continued maturing of the of the project, both in its partnerships with area schools and its facility with linking MoLLIE efforts to the area mandated curriculum. Relationships that were begun with area teachers in our first two years of operation continued and thrived. Those teachers that utilized MoLLIe in the first year actively promoted the MoLLIE project to their colleagues leading in turn, to an expanded clientele of teachers in a broader selection of&nbsp;schools.</p>
<p>Further relationships developed that Laura was crucial to: In conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice “Project Safe Neighborhoods” (PSN) program, Laura facilitated the efforts of local youths at neighborhood associations and community centers in writing, shooting, performing, and editing their own Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on the subject of gun violence prevention. Another partnership that developed this year in which Laura played a key role was a six month project with Wedgwood Christian Services of West Michigan. Similar to PSN, the Wedgwood project involved providing at-risk teens with the tools, training, and means of transmission to create their own mini documentaries and PSAs focusing on substance abuse prevention. Laura demonstrated a particular facility in getting young women to open up and tell their personal stories in a manner that they might not with male&nbsp;trainer/technicians.</p>
<p>Laura’s final, and perhaps most lasting project, done in conjunction with VISTA volunteer Nate Diedrich, has been the production of an eight-episode instructional module series on the MoLLIE method of video&nbsp;production.</p>
<p>Laura Craig went on to work full-time at Portland Community Media in Portland, Oregon, where she supervised the work of Digital Arts Corps Member Nickey&nbsp;Robare.</p>

                    <p>David has assisted TSN Coordinator with the procurement, development, distribution and evaluation of instructional materials for member&nbsp;sites.  </p>
<p>David has met with eligible sites independently and jointly with TSN coordinator as well as helped procure and disseminate information between sites and the TSN coordinator.  Because of David’s technical background and ability to grasp the complete picture he has resolved many problems and questions before they could become issues.  Once the financial issues are resolved, David will independently visit the Centers receiving equipment to ensure that its installation is complete and satisfies the Center’s requirements.  As a result of the David’s assistance the current round of hardware and furniture upgrades is ahead of last years&nbsp;pace. </p>
<p>David is serving as the Project Manager for the re-design of the website). Davis is coordinating the translation of a portion of the website into Spanish and is keeping the content of the web site up to date.  David frequently provides help desk support to members using the&nbsp;site. </p>
<p>David is currently serving as a fifth-grade group leader for the Kinetic City program. Kinetic City is a science-based program aligned with Boston Public School standards for grades 3-6 designed to be offered in out-of school time. David along with key staff from member sites will be trained to both run the program and sites as well as on how to train others to lead the program.  David will provide important feedback as we pilot this train-the-trainer program being developed jointly with MIT’s Kavli&nbsp;Institute.  </p>
<p>• David has developed and is maintaining two databases for managing the information needed for reporting to our funders—Boston Connects, Inc. and the Timothy Smith Fund. These databases track information for 40 sites, hundreds of classes, and thousands of&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>• David completed a series of classes at BNN TV’s Multimedia Center and used these new skills to video the recent Girls Get Connected Conference.  It is anticipated that he will turn this into a CD or DVD which can be used for publicity for upcoming conferences.  David will also use these skills to create a CD or DVD of success stories of individuCenter&nbsp;activities.</p>

                    <p>I must take this opportunity to comment on David directly.  He demonstrates a level of maturity far beyond that which I have seen from others in his position.  His attention to detail and in depth-technical skills have has enabled him to successfully create and<br />
maintain the databases critical to the TSN’s daily operation.  David’s work ethic is outstanding—he is never late, he is never absent, he never complains, he is totally reliable.  If I give his something to get done he does it on time and accurately with a minimum of input, much less supervision.  David demonstrates real depth and breadth of perspective in meetings with funders, meeting with TS Center staff, and in meetings with the TSN Steering Committee.  Of particular note is the “business acumen” he applies to the TSN which he acquired through planning his business in&nbsp;Milwaukee.</p>

                    <p>Alli, working as a VISTA volunteer, has filled a huge void for BNN by assisting in promotions and outreach to the community. Through her first six months at BNN she has assisted not only the organization, but BNN producers in getting their message&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>In Alli&#8217;s second year at BNN she held the position of Youth Media Coordinator. Her duties included organizing a teen media club and producing a monthly program with the teens in the&nbsp;club.</p>

                    <p>She is currently helping to organize, write, and format BNN’s quarterly newsletter, our most important piece of literature sent to our members.  The newsletter introduces new equipment in our facilities, editing and production tips, and production class schedules. BNN has been unable to produce a newsletter since last winter, due to lack of staff and time, so Alli’s assistance in this is especially crucial.  Once the newsletter is completed it will be mailed to approximately 500 members and BNN typically receives a positive response from a large number of&nbsp;recipients. </p>
<p>Another example of Alli’s reach to the community is BNN’s Neighborhood Network News Program Highlights which Alli has been in charge of for the past six months.  The Program Highlights require Alli to be in close contact to all of our producers and to contact various shows on a weekly basis.  The Highlights also require her to send out a bulk mailing each month encouraging producers to contact her and let her know about their show, so that BNN can assist them in reaching as many people in the community as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Not only is Alli reaching out to community members, but during the next six months a lot of her attention will go to reaching out to community organizations. BNN provides non-profit organizations in the Greater Boston area a chance to produce a PSA highlighting their organization’s cause.  Alli will be responsible for the production and editing of these PSA’s, and she will assist BNN’s Education/Outreach department in contacting the organizations through phone calls, mailings and most importantly a “Get Your Message Out”&nbsp;seminar. </p>
<p>Over the last six months Alli has been a vital part in increasing BNN’s reach to the Boston community.  She has kept daily communication with many of our producers and the productions that she has assisted on have gotten her out into the community and aided BNN in delivering community&nbsp;messages.</p>

                    <p>Approximately two weeks ago, the United Nations celebrated its annual International Day of Peace.  As UTEC was invited to participate in this event (celebrated in Boston), we decided to put together a videotape of how young people define peace in their own local communities.  Dirk was able to work with many young people to get this video accomplished and shown in front of all those in attendance at this event. There is some amazing footage on this tape, particularly of older gang members (ages 22-25) who speak about their own experiences of violence and how they are now working with UTEC’s Peace Team on mediation work with current gang members in Lowell.  Dirk did an excellent job of putting this work together so that it would best reflect the voices of these young&nbsp;people.</p>
