                    <p>Will assisted with the completion of the Spring 2006 class by helping to organize the graduation screening.  Shortly before that screening, Will recruited students and professional filmmaker mentors for the Fall 2006 class, which began in early October 2006.  The Fall 2006 class has now graduated (as of March 28, 2007) and again Will assisted with the organization of the graduation screening, our longest and best attended yet. This past winter, Will again recruited students and mentors, from regular partner schools and new partners, for the Spring 2007&nbsp;class.</p>
<p>The Reel Impact program has been completely overhauled with Will&#8217;s input and support into a series of workshops and working meetings on distribution and outreach for graduates of the Lab. He has been in charge of distributing our films over the web at four different partner websites - including Reel Works, ListenUp!, Uth TV, and AOL.  Will has been releasing a new film (from our library of over 100 films) every two weeks and last year we had over a million viewers of our work!  Our first Master Class, a yearlong advanced film production class, was recruited for and began in the late fall.  Will is currently arranging specialty workshops such as screenwriting and lighting for film for the Master Class&nbsp;students.  </p>
<p>Our first ever benefit was held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in November 2006, and Will contributed to the creation of the &#8220;Labumentary&#8221;, a film about Reel Works&#8217; mission, for the benefit screening.  He also coordinated our student workers for the evening, who were charged with selling tickets for and running the raffle at the benefit&nbsp;reception.  </p>
<p>This spring, we are in the process of strengthening our recruitment efforts with our partners at local schools and non-profit organizations.  Will is part of the team who is meeting with these partners, educating them fully about our mission and requirements and developing deeper bonds in order to reach more students who might be interested in our&nbsp;programs.  </p>
<p>All of these activities that Will has been in charge of and assisting with are directly affecting the ability of Reel Works to reach more and more of New York City&#8217;s teens who are interested in developing critical thinking, media literacy, self-esteem and relationships with professionals in the field of&nbsp;filmmaking.</p>

                    <p>Over the past six months, Aspiration tracked the increased capacity of grassroots nonprofits to make informed decisions about their software selection through the Social Source Commons project. Our VISTA, Tim Wescott has spent the majority of his time ensuring that grassroots nonprofits know about what tools are available to them and how to find these tools within Social Source&nbsp;Commons. </p>
<p>In addition, Aspiration convened 3 events building nonprofit and NGO collaboration in creating tools that will benefit grassroots communities. These events brought together software users, developers, intermediaries, and investors.  Tim participated and worked hands on with these constituents to encourage collaboration, skill and knowledge sharing in the nonprofit software&nbsp;realm. </p>
<p>Tim&#8217;s ongoing work is helping Aspiration achieve its mission of connecting nonprofits with software solutions that help them better carry out their&nbsp;work.</p>

                    <p>The WTA is establishing a community technology center (CTC) for the homeless as the CCNV shelter.  It provides technology access and training programs for the shelter population, as well as other disadvantaged populations utilizing it.  The VISTA member will train the homeless, then cultivate them to become full-time volunteers at the&nbsp;center. </p>
<p>These trained volunteers will build a self-sustaining service-learning model where trained members of the homeless community gain work-based learning experiences by performing vital technology repair and training services for local non-profit organizations and government agencies.  Small fees will be charged, just enough to self-sustain the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Phase I: Train the VISTA member in WTA service-learning performance tasks (see above).  The VISTA member spends a period of time pacticing these skills by training many members of the homeless community in the CCNV in&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Phase II:  Provide the homeless with professional technology job experience by operating a real high-tech company.   The VISTA member will be trained in the WTA Enterprise Curriculum and will use it to train and support advanced volunteers from the shelter in performing technology service-learning for the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Phase III: Armed with job experience provided in Phase II, service-learning volunteers have a better chance to obtain technology employment or to open their own firms. For a very small group of homeless having the skill set yet lacking the resources and confidence to start their own firms, the WTA and CCNV will provide desk space and the VISTA member will train and support them so they can open their own technology firms in the WTA/CCNV&nbsp;building.</p>

                    <p>Tony recruited 5 executive board members (all volunteers and all homeless) to lead the governance of WildTech-CCNV. ed the acquisition of all surplus technology for&nbsp;refurbishing. </p>
<p>Tony single-handedly landed a 200 computer donation from AARP, which will be distributed across the&nbsp;region.</p>
<p>Tony rebuilt two technology access labs in the shelter, providing technology access for 1300&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Implemented three sets of 12 week training classes for shelter residents. These included:<br />
1. MS Word<br />
2. MS Excel<br />
3. Introduction to Computers<br />
4. Computer&nbsp;refurbishing</p>
<p>Tony refurbished enough laptop computers to award to every homeless graduate of the 12 week training&nbsp;sessions.</p>
<p>Tony began building an eBay ecommerse training class so homeless can start selling on&nbsp;eBay.</p>
<p>Tony began building a city-wide computer recycling program and assisted in writing a proposal that was submitted to federal GSA and the District of Columbia to have homeless people manage their recyclable&nbsp;electronics.</p>
<p>Managed the writing of 5 grants to five agencies. All writing was done by homeless&nbsp;people.</p>

                    <p>Laura assisted with preparations for two significant events: the Community Media Summit and the Community Wireless Summit. Both events brought out grassroots community activists and leaders in the field. Public discourse on digital divide issues moved significantly nationwide towards a language of &#8220;digital inclusion&#8221;. The terminology of digital inclusion is advanced in a top-down and paternalistic manner. The grassroots and more explicitly open discourse on digital excellence has allowed the public to set the bar higher and to explore solutions to local problems that do not presuppose a technology or a topology, and which do not impose a top-down solution. The Chicago grassroots statement on Digital Excellence has been picked up by the City elite in a major public document, in large measure a result of our public education campaign that was facilitated by&nbsp;Laura.</p>

                    <p>Our VISTA member will work with targeted low-income communities to ensure children (pre-Kindergarten through 8th grade) have access to computer technology and that the digital divide that currently seperates the low-income from the affluent continously decreases. Members will increase the capacity of the CTC and utilize technology resources &#8211; specifically the programs and facilities of the CTC &#8211; to educate, inform, and empower youth and adults to participate in community decision-making and local&nbsp;governance. </p>
<p>The CTC VISTA will<br />
-  engage in outreach to low-income communities that connects families with CTC<br />
-  work with  local youth advisory groups to identify other CTCs and get the word out to the public<br />
-  secure computers from local companies to distribute to the poor<br />
-  introduce new software to youth attending the CTC<br />
-  expand after school computer lab programs<br />
-  recruit and train volunteers to deliver programs<br />
-  evaluate program outcomes<br />
-  investigate funding sources and contribute to the organization&#8217;s grant writing effort<br />

                    <p>Renae has collaborated with city and county agencies to create strong strategic alliances with the PINK HOUSE. She keeps on top of the changes and new programs that are provided by these agencies and continually keeps in touch with the community leaders to inform them of the programs being&nbsp;implemented.</p>
<p>Though I always come up with the purpose of the event, Renae never ceases to amaze me in the way she plans and prepares for an event. She coordinates, decorates, handles the media, finds the volunteers through programs set forth in her prior years of service from creation to completion of the&nbsp;event.</p>
<p>Through these hard times, Renae still continues to get our local community businesses to commit to the children and the community. She keeps in touch with our partners. She continues to create, implement, and maintain our technological programs for the youth using service&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Renae also worked The College of Charleston public relations department and was instrumental in our center receiving a team to create branding for the center as well as a solid volunteer base through the program they&nbsp;created.</p>
<p>The third grade class was in charge of creating the newsletter for the center this term. They had to select the team themselves. She monitored as they elected a editor, decided who would be the photographer, journalist etc.. Each child was given a job. They learned skills in creative writing, photography, making advertisements, team organizing and working together as a&nbsp;team.</p>

                    <p>The broad focus of Kristen&#8217;s work over the past year was marketing and public relations—helping to make NTRC and our programs more visible in the&nbsp;community.</p>

                    <p>Kristen produced a variety of written materials and marketing collateral for potential partners, funders, and clients. She assumed responsibility for our quarterly newsletter; created and distributed flyers, postcards, and brochures for all three sites; and provided the photography, design, and some of the written content for our annual report. In addition to Kristen&#8217;s writing and design work, she organized several events designed to increase public awareness of our offerings, including job fairs and open houses. Finally, Kristen helped NTRC evaluate and improve its community engagement efforts through focus groups and an internal SWOT analysis. Although marketing was the main focus of her VISTA year, Kristen contributed to NTRC’s day-to-day operations by representing the organization at meetings and outreach events; contributing research, editing, and proofreading services; and performing or creating interviews, surveys, and other workforce development tasks. Kristen&#8217;s impact on the organization can be seen in three major ways: first, NTRC marketing materials have stepped up several levels because of her efforts; second, NTRC hosted a successful job fair in August 2007 with over 100 participants; and third, NTRC produced a visually impressive and content rich Year 2 Report for our Chicago Housing Authority funded &#8220;Make IT a Priority&#8221; Training Program Report in the Spring of&nbsp;2007. </p>
<p>The best story to demonstrate Kristen&#8217;s contributions to NTRC is to tell you what we did when Kristen&#8217;s year-long commitment was complete. Despite the fact that prior to her arrival, the position that Kristen filled did not exist, NTRC offered her full-time employment at the termination of her VISTA year because during that year, Kristen proved herself to be a vital member of the team and not someone we were willing to give up. Other than that, most of Kristen&#8217;s contributions are best viewed, rather than told. The dramatic improvement in our marketing materials, quarterly newsletters, and reports speak for&nbsp;themselves.</p>

                    <p>Erica made a good start on fundraising with the development and distribution of our annual appeal letter sent in Dec. This was fairly successful for our first try and raised over $1,500. During that time she was able to pull the current databases together, add new donors and businesses. All of that was in preparation for merging into the donor management/fundraising software HandyCapable had purchased. The next large piece was the planning of the first &#8220;event&#8221; for our organization which was well on it&#8217;s way by Dec. 2006 and planned for April 2007. Erica also send out a business letter to help raise awareness of our program, the need for donated computers, volunteers and&nbsp;funding.</p>

                    <p>Richard was a crucial part of the Mollie youth video team, providing youth access and exposure to digital video technology during Mollie moviemaking video projects with schools and community groups. Richard was especially instrumental in the use of digital audio technology, integrating audio technology into the Mollie youth projects and other GRCMC&nbsp;departments.</p>

                    <p>Richard assisted the education department with youth outreach curriculum development efforts, developing innovative ways to expose community youth to digital audio and video technology. He developed interest surveys for school and community info. gathering and assisted with the implementation of an open house for CMC Wealthy neighborhood residents. Richard was a member of the SMART Festival planning team, an international student media arts festival organized and hosted by&nbsp;GRCMC..</p>
<p>A particular story that stands out is the use of audio resources and curriculum developed by Richard: There was a young man named Patrick who was 14 years of age and lived across the street from Media Center with his Mom and 6 brothers and sisters. He would drop by the media center often after school. He learned a variety of video production skills and produced a few short studio productions for air on community television, but nothing seemed to really stick with him.  One day we asked him to produce and record a rap that could be used for promotion of the Mollie youth program. You could see the excitement in his eyes at that suggestion. In a matter of weeks he had the rap written out and beats to use with it created on the computer.  Using the tools and resources Richard had collected and organized, we were able to both find a passion for this young man and help promote our programs and&nbsp;organization.</p>

                    <p>Aaron has worked on a variety of fundraising, PR, and development projects. His main projects include: setting up a database to better organize our individual donor stewardship and cultivation campaign, working with corporate sponsors to secure technology equipment for UTEC&#8217;s new youth center, and instituting a new giving program for local&nbsp;corporations.</p>

                    <p>Aaron has done a significant amount of work with these projects, securing donations of large scale pieces of equipment for UTEC as well as really streamlining the research, cataloging, and time line of our donor campaigns using online research tools and creating a database. He has also done some PR work designing materials for our corporate giving campaign. Additional projects include writing two grants and securing funding for our sports and recreation program. And updating and refining our donor mailing list which we use to send out newsletters, annual appeals, and other updates. He also worked to coordinate and publicize one fundraising event: an organ concert which drew over 60 people to the center, raised $500 and generated an enormous amount of local publicity for UTEC. We&#8217;ve had some challenges in focusing these projects in a way that priorities are clear so that deadlines will be met, as there is such a large number of projects to be covered in terms of the fund raising needs of the youth center. Aaron has done a great job of learning more organizational methods, and is putting them into practice in new ways that are really helping his&nbsp;work.</p>

                    <p>Aaron&#8217;s behind-the-scenes service to UTEC and the Lowell community has impacted young people&#8217;s lives and their access to resources, particularly technology in so many ways. Recently, Aaron contacted our donors and worked through their networks to secure donations and discounts of computer hardware. His work secured a deep discount of new model PCs and these will be purchased in the next few months. His hard work has ensured new technology for free teen use in our tech center. These young people typically do not have computers or internet access at home, so the addition of newer, faster computers to the tech center will ensure many more young people get access to the Internet each day for help with research, homework, job seeking and&nbsp;communication.</p>
