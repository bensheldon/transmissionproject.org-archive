                    <p>The Collins Center, named in honor of Governor LeRoy Collins (served 1955 – 1961), was established in 1988 as a statewide nonprofit organization to seek out creative, non-partisan solutions to Florida’s toughest issues. Throughout our history, we have strived to uphold the principles maintained by Governor Collins&#8211; public and private integrity, deliberative democracy, environmental stewardship and economic&nbsp;fairness.</p>
<p>While we conduct comprehensive and quality public policy analysis, what makes the Collins Center unique is our desire to see changes in public policy implemented. To take an active role in putting these changes to the test. According to Collins Center president Rod Petrey, &#8220;We don’t just study problems and write position papers. We actually implement pilot projects and experimental programs to determine how our resolutions to problems will work. Then we’re able to share this information so others can use the&nbsp;knowledge.”</p>
<p>Since 1988, we have focused on many problems that have changed the lives of Floridians and impacted state&nbsp;policy.</p>
<p>We have heard Floridians speak with great passion about their voting rights and the importance of knowing their vote counted.<br />
We have seen looks of relief on the faces of homeowners when they were able to reach a settlement with their insurance company following a life-threatening hurricane.<br />
We have witnessed young men from Overtown give testimony before congressional representatives in Washington on the critical impact men’s health care has on low-income neighborhoods.<br />
We have awarded small businesses and other organizations for new and creative ways to protect the environment while maintaining economic success.<br />
We have received heart-felt thank you letters from people who received much needed medical attention through the efforts of our Community Health Workers.<br />
We have worked in the Overtown community, just north of downtown Miami, to begin new development that will provide residents with new housing options, new job opportunities and a positive step toward returning this historic neighborhood to a vibrant community.<br />
We have established a mortgage foreclosure mediation program to help resolve disputes between homeowners and their mortgage lenders, allowing many families to stay in their&nbsp;homes.</p>

The following activities are&nbsp;proposed:</p>
<p>1.  Update and maintain zip code searchable database system for community technology access throughout the region.  The system maps all community technology programs in the tri-county region with a database of detailed information for each and is searchable by zip code or keyword.  The database system is useful for increasing technology access for those impacted by the digital divide, for those that work with them via other programs, and their&nbsp;advocates.</p>
<p>2. Provide technology and resource development related technical assistance to existing and start-up community technology programs in the tri-county region via an evolving co-op service model which will make access to hardware, software and services more cost effective for human services organizations.  To include planning and start-up, discounted co-op tech services and software, technical advice, assistance with set-up and upgrading, matching of volunteers, assistance with grant writing, in-kind donation and fundraising strategies. Municipal broadband initiatives, faith based projects and community and school efforts may be targeted to help ensure maximal digital inclusion. Work with iCoast to develop a pool of volunteers and corporate in-kind&nbsp;donations.</p>
<p>3. Provide support/referral and assistance and/or become involved with cross community programs such as One Community, WiFi Miami Beach, the South Florida Regional Equitable Connection web portal, Elevate Miami and the eSeniors and eParks program, and others as they are identified or&nbsp;evolve.</p>
<p>4. Research sustainable best practices relevant to community technology in the South Florida region, including both local and national practices, to be distributed through written report and communications&nbsp;materials. </p>
<p>5. Assist with policy-related research and field activities relevant to community technology issues in the region, including home and after-school technology use by students and other&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>6. Host quarterly meetings of the Technology Access Coalition (TAC), to bring together agencies and organizations providing community technology programming or interested in the issue.   TAC may be renamed by the&nbsp;group.</p>
<p>7.  Participate in other related capacity and consensus building activities as&nbsp;feasible.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Two conferences were organized to serve the funding, advocacy, and planning needs of nonprofit technology organizations (Jan. and June 08). The conferences established a platform for joint advocacy and inter-agency relations for nonprofits, positioning them in relation to the Donor&#8217;s Forum, Knight Foundation, and related initiatives such as OneCommunity and Florida 2.0. Through the conferences and community relations, positive relations were established and maintained with key partners such as InternetCoast, OneCommunity, and Florida 2.0. Through the co-op Victoria helped to establish a new CTC lab (Hialeah Gardens), strengthen existing programs, increase communication and collaboration between participants. Assessments were conducted with Crossfire, Cutler Bay Parks and Recreation, Inner City Youth, Center for Independent Living, WeCount (Cutler Bay), WeCount (Homestead) and the North Miami Beach Intel Clubhouse. Volunteers were recruited through Refresh Miami meetings and various online sources, and the first volunteer orientation took place in June 08. These activities were the culmination of planning and outreach that began in November 07, when the co-op strategy was initially developed. As a result of positive progress on these fronts, Victoria was hired by Collins Center to work jointly with the initiative and with&nbsp;InternetCoast.</p>
<p>CTC&#8217;s expressed appreciation and volunteered to write support letters for the project. Key partners likewise expressed appreciation for the work of the project and have made plans for ongoing collaboration. The most illustrative story is that InternetCoast asked Victoria if she would be willing to coordinate their own program activities, and together we developed a jointly funded position for 2008-09 that will enable Victoria to coordinate the work of nonprofit and for-profit technology sectors, and to better develop linkages between the&nbsp;two.</p>

        Project Outcome:
      </label>
                <span class="field-content"><p>Kevin Bulger was responsible for very successfully assisting the technical and organizational development of the South Florida Regional Equity website with the co-supervision of a Collins Center staff. He assisted with the asset mapping of some 212 South Florida region community technology programs and access locations. He was also involved in policy and planning initiatives related to community efforts such as Wireless Miami Beach. Kevin assisted in writing grants for CTI and researched available grants. When Victoria Edwards began her service, additional grants were written and the asset mapping of agencies continued with the two VISTA&#8217;s working together on these projects. Meetings with agencies led to the development of the concept of creating memberships and co-op services to CTC&#8217;s and access projects in the region. Meetings have taken place with a number of community organizations to assist in securing and deploying volunteers as an element of co-op services. A conference event for 30 CTC&#8217;s and related organizations was organized in January 2008. Both VISTA&#8217;s have come up with some excellent and innovative ideas and concepts for the project, which would often be integrated into grants, or service concepts that have been incorporated into the co-op plan for CTC&#8217;s. It was decided to eliminate the work on focus groups to instead center efforts around working with provider agencies on the co-op services&nbsp;concept.</p>
<p>Kevin&#8217;s diverse organizational skills allowed him not only to help develop a web portal for equity resources (<a href="http://www.sflregionalequity.org" title="www.sflregionalequity.org">www.sflregionalequity.org</a>), but encouraged the project director to involve him in a series of follow-up activities including newsletter and conference development. Following his service (ending late Jan.), his value is demonstrated by his being hired for part-time work by another hosted initiative operating under the Collins Center. While not all objectives were accomplished in the program year, Kevin&#8217;s ethic and value are further confirmed by his continuing part-time volunteerism on the project after his service has&nbsp;ended.</p>

<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can’t say enough about how much it meant—not only to the staff of the HandyCapable Network who were busy getting the computers ready—but to the children who would not have received a computer if not for Anna’s&nbsp;diligence. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anna’s desire to see that every deserving child got a computer had her making trips to the school to ﬁ nd the children who had no phone, making deliveries to the homes of those without transportation, and finding interpreters to communicate with the families of the children who spoke minimal English. She also coordinated all of the transportation and logistics. She was&nbsp;amazing.
