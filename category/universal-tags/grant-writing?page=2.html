<p>Mark has also been working with the Family Literacy program, an off-site program where we provide literacy classes to parents in partnering elementary&nbsp;schools. </p>
<p>Mark has also been instrumental in integrating the community wide technology workshops offered during our Community Days.  Community Days take place on periodic Saturdays and are open to the community at large, especially the immediate neighborhood.  They offer a variety of educational workshops and social services.  During Community Day, Mark was able to hold an open computer lab with activities designed for children, as many of the Community Day activities were family&nbsp;oriented.</p>

                    <p>In short, Nathan is helping us build the sustainability to continue all of UTEC&#8217;s mission. He has spent much focus on building systems (i.e. donor recognition systems) so that his work will last longer than his immediate 1-year impact. he produced our first ever annual report!! And, he has excited the entire development departament about the possibilities inherent in individual donor fundraising through his infectious excitement about such&nbsp;fundraising.</p>

                    <p>Nathan has done an excellent job in his role as a VISTA here at UTEC! He  took on a leading role in coordinating UTEC&#8217;s most comprehensive and successfull fundraiser to date. He has contributed immensely by helping us organize and develop a new online grants database (which I strongly believe will be a model for other nonprofits on how to best integrate technology into their development work). He has written and won grants.   He has created a well organized foundation/donor recognition system that has substantially improved our capacity for relationship building with funders. And he has provided much excitement around the development of a new individual donor organization process. I have been very pleased with Nathan&#8217;s work (this being his first time in a development position as this) and would rehire him in a&nbsp;minute.</p>

                    <p>Nathan took a leading role in coordinating all aspects of our first major fundraiser. With our Dvelopment Director out sick for some time during this period, he was sometimes running this without a ton of support. He took this as a challenge and semed to be invigorated by the challenge&#8230; never pessimistic or overwhelmed by stress. In the end, we had nearly 200 guests attend and profited nearly $10,000. Moreover, all those who attended coninue today to talk about how professional and well orchestrated it was. Ultimately, Nathan was able to establish the inception of what will now be the annual fundraiser event for UTEC&#8230;.each year building upon the success of all his work this past&nbsp;year.</p>

                    <p>Our Americorps VISTA project focused on increasing the capacity and sustainability of UTEC&#8217;s Multimedia programs through various development-based responsibilities. Diliana was responsible for grantwriting (specifically focused on enhancing our community technology programs), organizing special events (fundraisers, open houses, etc.), coordinating phone-a-thons, developing PR materials and UTEC’s first-ever annual report.  Diliana was expected to work with and train teen leaders in all aspects of their development&nbsp;work. </p>
<p>Specific responsibilities&nbsp;included: </p>
<p>•Attend, participate, and occasionally facilitate all staff meetings and planning&nbsp;retreats.</p>
<p>•Serve as a counselor and role model for youth involved in the Fundraising&nbsp;Team. </p>
<p>•Design and carry out annual development&nbsp;workplan.</p>
<p>•Research and write grant&nbsp;proposals. </p>
<p>•Coordinate special event&nbsp;fundraisers. </p>

                    <p>Diliana’s background in communications has only strengthened her contribution to UTEC by focusing on increasing the capacity and sustainability of our multimedia programs through various development-based responsibilities.  She also works with and trains teen leaders of the Fundraising Team in all aspects of their development work.  In addition, she assists with the program development in the areas of video production, sound recording, and web design.  It is obvious what a tremendous asset Diliana is for our organization, but it is also apparent that Diliana herself has grown professionally from the hands-on development work of our multimedia programs.  She plans to continue this type of work well into the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Diliana has played a major role in being an active participant in the organization’s overall development.  She has consistently supported her co-workers, emphasizing the team environment at UTEC.  Diliana has the skills to bring an idea to life.  For instance, UTEC’s first major fundraiser will be taking place early next month.  Diliana worked with teens in the Fundraising Team to gather ideas/themes for the event.  Since then, she has developed and followed a timeline to make the event a future&nbsp;success!</p>
<p>Diliana has accomplished the following major tasks as based upon her workplan:<br />
•	Completion of first-ever UTEC newsletter (second issue now in progress)<br />
•	Just recently completed first-ever Annual Report.<br />
•	Completed three monthly Open House Nights (and built a system for carrying out this work).<br />
•	Developed new mailing list for all fundraising activities.<br />
•	Secured donations from various businesses as part of program ads for newsletter.<br />
•	Completed and submitted various grant applications (as well as grantwriting training course).<br />
•	Developed new bios for all staff.<br />
•	Currently documenting all work as part of a new Fundraising Resource Guide.<br />
•	Currently planning a special event fundraiser to support a new capital campaign.<br />
•	Interviewed and hired teen fundraising&nbsp;staff.</p>

                    <p>As the purpose of the AmeriCorps*VISTA program is to provide useful outreach to local communities, our participants echoed their sentiment through visible outreach and service projects. One example I am reminded of was the special PBS viewing of “Every Mother’s Son,” coordinated by Mr. Bentinez. The event called for local law enforcement agents and community members to come together in support of the idea of social change, justice and a forum for communication and healing. This project used the power of media and the passion of human nature to discuss the realities of police brutality in New York City. This event is also an example of a sustainable solution effort and the ability of change.<br />

                    <p>The property which provided space for our lab was sold to another owner.  The new owner wasn’t interested in keeping the programs.  We move all equipment which was held in storage for more than 7 months. We partnered with another local property and we moved twice to  new property.  Finally, in April we move to the final location for the computer&nbsp;lab.</p>
<p>These moves hindered Angela’s work with the lab.  However she was quite helpful in other areas.  She wrote the first MLK grant which was funded. She provided research for many of the grants that have been developed during the 8 months of her stay.  She developed the system for reporting and documenting for a new program brought on this year. She also developed the accounting and financial system documenting agency&nbsp;resources.</p>

She networked the computers to one laser printer and set up the eight new computers.  She developed a training curriculum for use with the summer and after-school&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>The positive results of the MLK grant provide an environmental program to teach youth about the value of our planet.  The youth also enjoyed a conference on “Discovering How Amazing you really are” and learning how to find the greatness within&nbsp;themselves.</p>
