 <title>Different frames of media justice</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/current/2010/1/different-frames-of-media-justice</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many wonderful threads to pull from &lt;a h ref=&quot;http://www.fex.org/assets/418_hjmjflocalorganizers2.pdf&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Media Justice Through the Eyes of Local Organizers&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, a field report from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fex.org/mjf/&quot;&gt;Funding Exchange Media Justice Fund&lt;/a&gt; that came out in September, 2009. In addition to analyzing the different frames groups may approach media and communications justice from, they also make clear that there can be no one-size-fits-all&amp;nbsp;approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Comparing her work in the Bay Area to her current work in Louisiana, Xochitl Bervara of Families and Friends of Louisiana&amp;#8217;s Incarcerated Children (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FFLIC&lt;/span&gt;) was surprised to find that public access &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and community radio are uniquely important for the families she works with in Louisiana because literacy rates are so low there. Public Access &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; in Louisiana is an important source of civic information. Community radio helps get people out to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FFLIC&lt;/span&gt; meetings. For community outreach, computers are unusual. Even phone-based outreach can be a challenge. Low-income people tend to rely on pay- as-you-go cell phones and numbers change&amp;nbsp;frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the Bay Area where local organizers told us “access is not an issue” staying in touch with some people can be extremely challenging. To stay in touch with transgender people of color who get caught up in the criminal justice system, Alexander Lee of the Transgender, Gender Variant and Intersex Justice Project often has to resort to tracking them down in person. He believes literacy, digital literacy and cultural discomfort all contribute to low internet usage among those he works with. As pay phones have disappeared, Alex says it’s actually harder than it used to be to stay in touch with this vulnerable population, especially those who have been recently released from jail or&amp;nbsp;prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of these challenges, most local organizers we spoke with are relying on internet-based communication tools to keep in touch with their constituencies including social networking, web 2.0 media, and collaborative hubs. Local organizers tend to be circumspect about using internet for their work. They tend to see it as one means of keeping in touch among many and not as a replacement for meetings, phone calls, and other forms of media.	They note that differences in demographics such as age and education still make a difference in people’s available and preferred means of keeping in touch. Most organizers said they needed to use multiple methods to keep in touch with the communities they serve. According to Ricardo Valadez of Jobs with Justice, the communications strategy that works with one demographic won’t work with another, “Most marketing and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; work relies on ‘hyper-targeting’ but that doesn’t work and isn’t desirable or feasible when your goal is to help people see their struggle in other people’s&amp;nbsp;struggles.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 <title>The Message is in the Music:  Hip Hop Feminism, Riot Grrrl, Latina Music, and More</title>
 <link>http://transmissionproject.org/events/2010/03/the-message-is-in-the-music-hip-hop-feminism-riot-grrrl-latina-music-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Twelfth Annual Women’s History Month Conference&lt;br /&gt;
at Sarah Lawrence College&lt;br /&gt;
Bronxville, New&amp;nbsp;York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Saturday, March 5 &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; 6,&amp;nbsp;2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker: Carmen Ashhurst, former president of Def Jam Recordings and Rush Communications, and author of the forthcoming book, Selling My Brothers: The Movement, The Media and&amp;nbsp;Me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music has long served social movements as a sound track, as a means of communication, and as its own arena for activism. While multiple generations of feminists have used music in these ways, it has played especially vital roles for those born since the 1970s. This conference will explore the ways in which young feminists have defined and expressed politics through music and musical cultures and communities. Among the questions we will ponder are: How does music reflect sites of agreement and conflict among different groups of feminists? How have movements like Riot Grrrl and Hip Hop feminism attracted young women to feminist activism? How do young feminists’ uses of music compare with those of earlier&amp;nbsp;generations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite activists, scholars and artists in all fields to propose papers, panels, workshops, performances, and&amp;nbsp;exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific topics may include, but are not limited&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Hip Hop Feminism&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminism in Latin Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Body Politics in the Music Industry&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminist Messages in World Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Young Feminists’ Musical Icons&lt;br /&gt;
    * Women-owned Record Labels&lt;br /&gt;
    * Zines in Feminist Culture&lt;br /&gt;
    * The Riot Grrrl Movement Lesbian Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * The Politics of Race in Feminist Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Misogyny in Contemporary Music&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminist Music Festivals&lt;br /&gt;
    * Women in Music Videos&lt;br /&gt;
    * Feminist Songwriters&lt;br /&gt;
    * Legacies of Women in Blues, Jazz, Rock, and&amp;nbsp;Folk&lt;/p&gt;
